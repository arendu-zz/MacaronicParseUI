a |0-0| Republican |2-2| strategy |1-1| to counter |3-4| the re @-@ election |5-6| of |7-7| Obama |8-8| 
 Republican |2-2| leaders |0-1| condoned |3-3| their policy |4-5| by |6-6| the need to |7-9| combat |10-11| electoral fraud |12-14| . |15-15| 
 however |0-0| , the |1-2| Brennan |4-4| Center |3-3| sees |5-5| it as |6-8| a myth |9-10| , |11-11| saying that |12-13| electoral fraud |14-16| is |17-17| rare |18-19| in the United States |20-23| that |24-24| the number |25-26| of |27-27| people killed |28-29| by |30-30| lightning |31-32| . |33-33| 
 indeed |0-1| , |2-2| Republican |5-5| lawyers |3-4| have not identified |6-8| as |9-9| 300 |10-10| cases of |11-12| electoral fraud |13-14| in the United States in |15-19| 10 years |20-21| . |22-22| 
 one thing is |0-2| certain : |3-4| these |5-5| new provisions |6-7| will affect |8-8| negatively |9-9| the participation rate |10-13| . |14-14| 
 in |0-0| this sense |1-2| , |3-3| these measures |4-5| will undermine |6-6| the |7-9| American |12-12| democratic system |10-11| . |13-13| 
 unlike Canada , the |0-4| U.S. states |5-6| are responsible for |7-9| the organization |10-11| of the |12-12| federal elections |13-14| in the United States |15-18| . |19-19| 
 it is in this spirit |0-4| that a majority |5-7| of |8-8| American |10-10| governments |9-9| from |12-14| 2009 |15-15| passed |11-11| new laws |16-18| making it more |19-20| difficult |21-21| for the registration process |22-25| or |26-27| vote |28-28| . |29-29| 
 this phenomenon |0-1| has grown |2-6| after |7-7| the elections |8-9| of |10-10| November |11-11| 2010 , |12-12| which saw |13-15| add |16-16| 675 |17-17| new |18-18| Republican |20-20| officials |19-19| in |21-21| 26 |22-22| states . |23-24| 
 accordingly |0-1| , |2-2| 180 |3-3| draft |4-5| laws restricting |6-7| the exercise |8-9| of the right |10-11| to vote |12-13| in |14-14| 41 states |15-16| were introduced |17-18| during the |19-20| 2011 |23-24| alone |21-22| . |25-25| 
 the new |0-1| election laws |2-3| require that |4-5| voters |6-7| show a |8-9| photo ID |10-14| and |15-15| proof of |16-18| U.S. citizenship |19-20| . |21-21| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| these laws |3-4| also reduce |5-6| the periods |7-8| of |9-9| polls , |10-13| invalidate |14-14| the right |15-16| to register |17-19| as a voter |20-21| on polling day |22-25| and |26-26| withdraw |27-27| to citizens with |28-30| a |31-31| criminal record |32-33| their right |34-35| to vote . |36-38| 
 before |0-0| the 2006 elections |1-4| , no |5-6| U.S. state |7-8| required |9-10| voters |11-12| to present |13-14| a |15-15| photo identification card |16-20| . |21-21| 
 Indiana |0-1| was the first |2-4| state to |5-6| ask |7-7| such a |8-9| requirement . |10-11| 
 the |0-0| United States Supreme |2-6| Court |1-1| upheld |7-7| in 2008 |8-9| the constitutionality |10-11| of |12-12| the law |13-14| in |15-15| Indiana |16-17| . |18-18| 
 the |0-0| Republican |2-2| authorities |1-1| clamoured |3-4| to extend |5-6| this practice |7-8| to other states |9-12| . |13-13| 
 over the past two |0-4| years , |5-6| they |7-7| sponsored |8-9| bills |10-12| in 34 |13-14| states |15-15| to force |16-17| voters |18-19| to present |20-21| a |22-22| photo identification card |23-27| . |28-28| 
 it |0-0| is important |1-2| to note |3-4| that , |5-6| unlike in |7-8| Quebec |9-9| , |10-10| American citizens |11-13| do not have |14-17| universal |21-21| identity card |18-20| as |22-22| the |23-23| health insurance |25-28| card |24-24| . |29-29| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| 11 |3-3| % of |4-5| American citizens |6-7| , |8-8| or 21 |9-10| million people |11-13| of voting age |14-17| , |18-18| do not have |19-22| photo identification |24-27| cards |23-23| issued by |28-29| a government agency |30-32| of their |33-34| state . |35-36| 
 in addition |0-1| , five |2-3| million |4-5| new voters |6-7| in 2012 |8-9| does |10-10| not have |11-13| such an |14-15| identification . |16-19| 
 however |0-0| , it |1-3| often costs |4-5| more than |6-7| one hundred dollars |8-9| to obtain |10-11| the |12-12| required |16-16| ID card |13-15| . |17-17| 
 the |0-0| new restrictions |1-2| disproportionately affect |3-6| young people |7-8| , minorities |9-11| and |12-13| low @-@ income people |14-18| . |19-19| 
 indeed |0-1| , 25 |2-3| % of |4-5| African @-@ Americans |6-8| , 15 |9-10| % |11-11| of those earning |12-14| less than |15-16| $ |19-19| 35,000 |17-18| ; |20-20| 18 |21-21| % |22-22| of citizens |23-24| over the age of 65 |25-29| and |30-30| 20 |31-31| % |32-32| of voters |33-34| aged 18 to |35-37| 29 |38-38| years |39-39| do not have |40-42| the |43-43| required |47-47| photo |48-49| ID card |44-46| . |50-50| 
 much more |0-1| . |2-2| 
 students |0-1| , |2-2| voters |3-4| considered |5-6| voting |7-7| more to |8-9| Democratic |12-12| candidates |10-11| , |13-13| are not allowed |14-17| in several |18-19| states to |20-21| use their |22-23| photo identification card |24-28| issued by |29-30| their institution |31-32| . |33-33| 
 however |0-1| , |2-2| these same |3-4| States allow |5-6| members |7-8| of |9-9| fishing |11-12| or hunting |13-15| clubs |10-10| who vote |16-17| more |18-18| on the Republican side |19-21| to use |22-23| for voting |24-25| cards issued |26-28| by |29-29| these clubs |30-31| . |32-32| 
 before |0-0| 2004 |1-1| , |2-2| no State |3-5| required |6-6| proof of citizenship |7-10| to vote |11-12| . |13-13| 
 Arizona |0-1| was the first to |2-5| introduce |6-6| such a |7-8| requirement . |9-10| 
 since |0-0| 2011 |1-1| , |2-2| a dozen |3-5| states have |6-7| passed laws |8-10| requiring |11-12| voters |13-13| to prove |14-15| they |16-17| are |18-18| U.S. citizens |19-20| . |21-21| 
 these measures |0-1| are clearly aimed |2-3| at limiting |4-5| the |6-6| Hispanic |8-8| vote |7-7| . |9-9| 
 however , |0-1| it appears |2-3| that two |4-5| out of three |8-9| Hispanic |7-7| voters |6-6| favor |10-10| the Democratic Party |11-13| . |14-14| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| Republican |5-5| lawmakers |3-4| have |6-6| sponsored |7-7| in 2011 |8-9| legislation |10-11| abolishing |12-12| voter registration |13-16| on polling day |17-20| in |21-21| eight states |22-23| . |24-24| 
 moreover |0-1| , they |2-3| have limited |4-5| the right |6-7| of individuals and groups |8-12| to provide assistance |13-16| to voters |17-18| wishing to |19-19| register |20-21| . |22-22| 
 these restrictions |0-1| are not |2-4| without |5-5| consequence . |6-7| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| during |3-4| the 2004 general election |5-9| , |10-10| voter registration |13-16| campaigns |11-12| have helped to |17-19| save |20-20| about 10 |21-22| million citizens |23-25| . |26-26| 
 however , |0-1| the measures |2-3| adopted since |4-5| 2009 |6-6| have |7-7| driven down |8-9| by 17 |10-11| % |12-12| the rate |13-14| of |15-15| registration |16-16| of |17-17| new voters |18-19| in 2010 |20-21| compared |22-23| to 2006 |24-25| . |26-26| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| Republican |5-5| lawmakers |3-4| have passed laws |6-9| in five |10-11| other states |12-13| to reduce |14-16| the period |17-18| of |19-19| advance voting . |20-23| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| in |3-4| the |5-5| 2008 |9-9| general election |6-8| in Florida |10-11| , |12-12| 33 |13-13| % |14-14| of voters |15-16| who |17-17| voted in advance |18-21| were |22-22| African @-@ Americans |23-25| , |26-26| while |27-28| they |29-30| accounted for only |31-33| 13 |34-34| % of |35-36| voters in |37-38| the state . |39-41| 
 the same was true |0-4| with |5-5| Hispanics |6-7| . |8-8| 
 they |0-2| accounted for only |3-5| 11 |6-6| % |7-7| of voters |8-9| , |10-10| but |11-11| 24 |12-12| per cent |13-13| of |14-14| citizens who |15-16| voted |17-17| in advance |18-19| . |20-20| 
 in return |0-1| , |2-2| the whites |3-4| who |5-5| accounted for |6-6| 76 |7-7| % |8-8| of voters |9-10| accounted for only |11-13| 46 |14-14| % of the |15-16| electorate |17-17| voting |18-18| in advance |19-20| . |21-21| 
 of course , |0-1| Democratic |4-4| legislators |2-3| and |5-5| their |6-6| supporters |7-7| strongly |11-11| objected |8-10| to |12-12| the adoption |13-14| of laws |15-16| restricting |17-17| voter registration |18-21| . |22-22| 
 several |0-0| bills |1-3| have |4-4| been |5-5| blocked by |6-7| the |8-8| Democratic |12-12| gubernatorial |10-11| vetoes |9-9| . |13-13| 
 the |0-0| Advocate General |1-2| of the |3-3| United States |4-6| intervened to |7-9| suspend |10-10| the most controversial |13-15| laws |11-12| . |16-16| 
 they |0-0| were able to |1-2| limit |3-3| the |4-6| damage . |7-8| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| only 16 |3-4| of 34 |5-6| states have |7-8| enacted laws |9-11| requiring the presentation of |12-15| a |16-16| photo identification card |17-21| . |22-22| 
 however , |0-1| the new rules |2-4| put in place |5-7| will |8-8| undoubtedly |9-9| make it more |10-11| difficult |12-12| the exercise |13-14| of the right |15-16| to vote |17-18| in 2012 |19-20| . |21-21| 
 democratic |2-2| critics |0-1| denounce the |3-4| partisan nature |5-6| of the laws |7-8| that have |9-10| been |11-11| passed |12-12| and |13-13| they |14-14| see it as |15-16| an obvious goal |17-19| to influence |20-21| the results |22-23| in 2012 |24-25| in |26-27| key |29-29| states |28-28| . |30-30| 
 a report by the |0-2| Brennan |4-4| Center |3-3| for |5-5| 2011 |6-6| shows that |7-8| the states |9-10| that have |11-12| adopted |13-13| such laws |14-15| account for |16-16| 171 |17-17| of the 270 |18-19| electoral |24-24| college |22-23| votes |20-20| needed |21-21| to win |25-26| the presidency |27-28| . |29-29| 
 it |0-0| is too |1-2| early to |3-4| say with certainty |5-7| that these |8-9| legislative changes |10-11| to |12-13| the electoral system |14-16| will have a significant impact |17-20| on |21-21| the outcome |22-23| of the |24-24| 2012 presidential |26-28| elections |25-25| . |29-29| 
 but |0-0| one thing is |1-3| certain : |4-5| these |6-6| new provisions |7-8| will affect |9-9| negatively |10-10| the participation rate |11-14| . |15-15| 
 in |0-0| this sense |1-2| , |3-3| these measures |4-5| will undermine |6-6| the |7-9| American |12-12| democratic system |10-11| . |13-13| 
 prostate |3-5| cancer screening |0-2| : |6-6| pass the test |7-9| or not |10-11| ? |12-12| 
 indeed |0-1| , the |2-3| PSA |5-6| test |4-4| would |7-7| sometimes |8-8| erroneous results |9-11| , |12-12| with |13-13| false |14-15| negative results |16-17| or |18-20| false positives |21-22| , |23-23| which |24-24| lead to |25-26| unnecessary medical |28-29| interventions |27-27| . |30-30| 
 what |0-1| do |2-2| hesitate |3-3| even more |4-5| men |6-7| already |8-8| reluctant to |9-10| get tested |11-15| . |16-16| 
 pass the test |0-2| or not |3-4| ? |5-5| 
 we asked |0-2| the opinion |3-4| of two |5-6| specialists . |7-8| 
 in studies |0-2| conducted |3-3| in the United States |4-7| , |8-8| there was |9-11| a lot |12-12| of contamination |13-14| between the |15-16| control groups |17-18| , |19-19| so it is |20-22| difficult |23-23| to interpret |24-25| these data |26-27| and |28-28| to have |29-30| firm recommendations |31-33| . |34-34| 
 another study |0-2| , |3-3| this one |4-6| , |7-8| found a |9-12| difference |13-13| in mortality |14-15| among |16-16| patients |17-18| who |19-19| were |20-21| screened |22-23| and |24-24| those who did |25-29| not |30-31| . |32-32| 
 this |0-0| study also showed |1-4| , |5-5| with |6-6| a |7-7| follow @-@ up |8-8| after |9-9| 12 years |10-11| , |12-12| that |13-13| it was |14-15| between |16-16| 30 and |17-18| 40 |19-19| per cent more |20-22| likely |23-24| to have |25-26| metastases |27-28| if |29-29| it |30-30| is not |31-33| detected |34-34| . |35-35| 
 I therefore recommend |0-2| the test |3-4| from |5-7| 50 |8-8| years ago , |9-10| or |11-11| from |12-14| 40 |15-15| years if |16-17| it |18-18| has |19-19| a |20-20| direct |22-22| parent |21-21| who |23-23| has already had |24-26| prostate |29-31| cancer |27-28| . |32-32| 
 the |0-0| African @-@ American |2-6| men |1-1| are also |7-8| at greater risk |9-11| . |12-12| 
 the key |0-1| is to |2-3| make the right decision |4-7| once |8-10| cancer |14-15| was detected |11-13| . |16-16| 
 there are |0-3| aggressive |5-5| cancers |4-4| and |6-6| others |7-8| who |9-9| are indolent |10-11| . |12-12| 
 we really need |0-2| to |3-3| understand |4-4| the degree |7-8| of |9-9| risk |10-10| to the patient |5-6| &apos;s |11-12| cancer , |13-14| by offering |15-17| options |18-20| , |21-22| does |23-23| not necessarily |25-26| treating |24-24| prostate |29-31| cancers |27-28| that do |32-33| not affect |34-37| the |38-38| long @-@ term |40-42| life |39-39| , |43-43| and |44-45| opting instead |46-47| , |48-48| in these cases |49-53| , |54-54| for active surveillance |55-58| of |59-59| the disease |60-61| . |62-62| 
 today |0-1| , many men |2-5| who |6-8| detects |9-9| cancer |10-11| will not be |12-14| treated |15-15| because |16-17| their |18-18| cancer |19-19| is not |20-22| aggressive and |23-24| does not threaten |25-27| their lives |28-29| . |30-30| 
 we will |0-1| suggest |2-3| to make |4-6| active |9-9| surveillance |7-8| and |10-10| if |11-11| the disease |12-13| progresses , |14-15| we will |16-17| offer them |18-19| treatment . |20-22| 
 increasingly |0-3| , it |4-5| accurately |7-8| determine |6-6| the criteria |9-10| for |11-11| deciding who |12-13| should |14-14| or |15-15| should not |16-18| be treated |19-20| . |21-21| 
 I therefore recommend |0-2| still |3-4| to pass |5-6| the test |7-8| . |9-9| 
 but |0-0| the important thing is |1-3| to have |4-5| a discussion with |6-8| her doctor |9-10| to determine whether |11-13| or not |18-19| it should |14-16| go |17-17| . |20-20| 
 in collaboration |0-1| with |2-2| the |3-3| International Society |4-5| of Urology |6-7| , |8-8| Movember |9-9| created |10-11| a tool |12-15| to evaluate |16-17| the pros and cons |18-22| of the |23-23| PSA |25-26| test |24-24| . |27-27|

 prevent |0-0| the disease |1-2| 
 unfortunately , there is |0-3| no |4-5| miracle |7-7| recipe |6-6| to prevent |8-9| cancer . |10-12| 
 despite |0-0| the progress |1-2| of |3-3| the search |4-5| , |6-6| the adoption |7-8| of |9-9| healthy lifestyles , |10-13| remains the |14-15| best way |16-17| to reduce |18-19| the risk |20-21| to |22-22| suffer . |23-25| 
 it is estimated |0-1| that |2-2| if everyone |3-6| ate |7-7| well and |8-9| moved |10-10| well enough |11-11| , |12-12| it could |13-14| prevent |15-15| 30 |16-16| % |17-17| of cancers |18-19| . |20-20| 
 &quot; if |0-1| nobody |2-4| smoked |5-5| , |6-6| the rate |7-8| would rise to |9-10| at least |11-12| 50 |13-13| % |14-14| , &quot; says |15-17| André |18-18| Beaulieu |19-19| , |20-20| spokesman for |21-24| the Canadian Cancer Society |25-29| . |30-30| 
 however |0-1| , |2-2| it is estimated |3-4| that about |5-6| 10 |7-7| % of |8-9| cancers are |10-11| caused by |12-13| heredity |14-15| . |16-16| 
 several |0-0| also remain |1-2| totally |3-3| unexplained |4-4| . |5-5| 
 for |0-0| the Canadian Cancer Society |1-5| , |6-6| the fight |7-8| against |9-9| smoking |10-11| remains |12-12| a priority |13-14| , |15-15| despite |16-16| the decrease |17-18| in the number |19-20| of smokers |21-22| . |23-23| 
 cigarette smoking |0-1| is linked |2-3| to 85 |4-5| % of |6-7| lung |11-12| cancer cases |8-10| . |13-13| 
 it |0-0| is also |1-2| a risk factor |3-6| for |7-7| several others |8-9| . |10-10| 
 this |0-0| is highly detrimental to |1-3| people &apos;s health |4-7| . |8-8| 
 &quot; |0-0| even today , |1-4| there are |5-7| 1.5 million |8-10| smokers |11-11| in Quebec |12-13| , &quot; |14-15| said |16-16| the spokesman |17-20| Andre |21-21| Beaulieu |22-22| . |23-23| 
 encouraging |1-1| data |0-0| : |2-2| 10 |3-3| years after |4-5| quitting |6-10| , |11-11| the risk |12-13| of dying |14-15| from cancer |16-18| fall |19-19| by half |20-21| . |22-22| 
 the weight |0-1| 
 overweight |0-1| and |2-2| obesity |3-4| also promote |5-6| the emergence |7-8| of |9-9| the disease |10-11| , |12-12| according to |13-13| the |14-14| CSC . |15-16| 
 they |0-0| would increase |1-1| the risk |2-3| of breast cancer |4-7| , colon |8-10| and |11-11| rectum |12-13| , esophagus |14-17| , pancreas |18-20| and |21-22| uterus |23-24| . |25-25| 
 &quot; |0-0| research shows |1-3| that regular |4-8| physical activity |9-11| for a lifetime |12-15| protects |16-16| against |17-17| colon cancer |18-21| , &quot; |22-23| it |28-28| says |24-27| . |29-29| 
 the food |0-1| 
 the agency |0-1| also recommends |2-3| to limit |4-5| its consumption |6-7| of red meat |8-10| . |11-11| 
 too much |0-3| , |4-4| it |5-5| raises |6-7| the risk |8-9| of developing |10-13| colorectal |16-16| cancer |14-15| . |17-17| 
 charcuterie |0-1| , too , |2-3| and |4-4| they should |5-6| be avoided |7-8| . |9-9| 
 conservation |0-1| of |2-2| meat |3-4| by |5-5| smoking , drying |6-8| or |9-9| salting |10-10| can lead to |11-12| the formation |13-14| of |15-15| carcinogenic substances |16-17| . |18-18| 
 &quot; |0-0| they |1-2| can damage |3-4| the cells |5-6| of |7-7| the body |8-9| and |10-10| lead |11-11| to the development |12-13| of cancer |14-15| , &quot; |16-17| it |22-22| says |18-21| . |23-23| 
 the vitamins |0-1| 
 in recent |0-3| years , |4-5| many scientists |6-7| have studied |8-9| the links |10-11| between |12-13| vitamin supplements |14-15| and cancer |16-18| . |19-19| 
 their research |0-1| , however , are not |2-5| conclusive |6-6| for |7-7| the moment |8-9| . |10-10| 
 studies on |0-2| vitamin |3-4| E |5-5| are contradictory |6-7| , |8-8| according to |9-9| the |10-10| CSC . |11-12| 
 while |0-1| one of them |2-5| was a |6-7| reduced risk of |8-11| prostate cancer |12-15| , |16-16| another |17-18| noted |19-19| an |20-21| increase |22-22| . |23-23| 
 the effect |0-1| of |2-2| vitamin |3-4| D |5-5| on cancer |6-8| is not |9-11| clear |12-13| either . |14-16| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| Mr. |3-3| Beaulieu |4-4| emphasizes |5-6| the importance |7-8| of |9-9| talking about |10-11| his concerns |12-13| and |14-15| his |16-16| family history |17-18| with |19-19| his doctor |20-21| . |22-22| 
 &quot; |0-0| a |1-2| screening test |3-5| , |6-6| it |7-7| does not give |8-10| cancer |11-12| . &quot; |13-14| 
 the |0-0| Higgs boson |1-3| husked |4-4| 
 the announcement |0-1| of |2-2| the discovery |3-4| of the |6-6| Higgs boson |7-9| likely |5-5| created |10-11| quite a stir , |12-15| last summer |16-18| , and for good reason |19-22| . |23-23| 
 it is believed |0-1| that |2-4| the |5-5| boson |6-6| is involved |7-7| in the mechanism |8-9| responsible for |10-11| the mass |12-13| of all things |14-16| in |17-17| the universe |18-19| , nothing less |20-23| . |24-24| 
 and |0-0| then |1-2| there |3-3| is the last |4-8| particle |9-9| whose existence |10-12| is |13-13| predicted by |14-15| the |16-16| Standard Model |17-18| - |19-19| our best |20-21| , |22-22| or &quot; |23-24| least |25-25| worst &quot; |26-27| explanation of |28-29| the nature |30-31| and behavior |32-34| of matter |35-37| - |38-38| but |39-39| that has not |40-43| yet been |44-45| observed |46-46| empirically |47-47| . |48-48| 
 but |0-0| for |1-1| physicists |2-3| , it |4-5| is still not |6-9| completely |10-10| sure |11-11| whether |12-15| the |16-17| Higgs |18-18| . |19-19| 
 we know |0-1| without |2-2| a shadow of a |3-6| doubt that |7-8| there |9-10| is |11-11| a genuine |12-13| new |14-14| particle |15-15| , |16-16| and |17-17| it |18-19| looks very much like the |20-22| Higgs boson |23-25| predicted |26-26| by the |27-28| Standard Model |29-30| . |31-31| 
 in addition |0-1| , new data |2-5| released |6-6| this week |7-8| at a |9-11| major conference |12-13| of Physics |14-15| at |16-17| Kyoto , |18-19| seem to |20-20| confirm this |21-22| , |23-23| but |24-24| it |25-25| still lacks |26-27| data |28-29| to |30-31| be |32-32| perfectly |33-33| clear |34-34| . |35-35| 
 suppose |0-0| all the same |1-3| whether |4-7| the |8-9| Higgs |10-10| , |11-11| because |12-12| the chances |13-14| of being wrong |15-17| seem |18-18| slim |19-19| , |20-20| and |21-21| see |22-22| what it is |23-27| . |28-28| 
 there is |0-2| , in |3-4| this world |5-7| , |8-8| a law |9-10| fatally |11-11| unavoidable |12-12| that |13-14| two things |15-16| may not |17-19| be |20-21| in the same place |22-24| at the same time . |25-28| 
 no way |0-1| to break |2-3| this rule |4-5| - |6-6| and |7-7| don &apos;t try |8-10| too hard |11-12| , you &apos;re going to |13-15| hurt you . |16-19| 
 however , even if the |0-3| particle physics |4-6| is a |7-8| very strange |10-11| world |9-9| , |12-12| it turns out |13-15| that it |16-17| , too , has |18-22| a law |23-24| like this |25-27| : |28-28| the |29-29| Pauli exclusion principle |30-34| , |35-35| which states |36-37| that two |38-39| particles |40-40| cannot |41-43| occupy the |44-45| same space |46-47| at the same time |48-50| if |51-51| they are |52-53| in the |54-55| same |56-56| quantum |59-59| state |57-58| &quot; |60-60| - |61-61| the |62-62| &quot; |63-63| state |64-64| &quot; |65-65| of |66-66| roughly |67-68| in |69-69| some of |70-71| their characteristics |72-73| . |74-74| 
 from there |0-1| , |2-2| the |3-3| particle |6-7| physicists |4-4| fall |5-5| into two |8-9| categories . |10-11| 
 in one corner |0-2| , |3-3| there are |4-5| good citizens |6-8| appointed |9-9| fermions |10-10| , |11-11| who |12-12| wisely |14-14| obey |13-13| the |15-15| Pauli principle |16-18| . |19-19| 
 and |0-0| in |1-1| another |2-3| move |4-5| bosons |6-7| , |8-8| a dirty |9-10| band |11-11| of |12-12| anarchists |13-13| who |14-14| have no |15-17| respect for anything |18-20| - |21-21| at least , not |22-26| for |27-27| this principle |28-29| , |30-30| which means |31-33| they |34-35| may well |36-39| find themselves |40-41| in the same place |42-44| , |45-45| at the same time . |46-49| 
 these |0-0| bosons |1-1| then broke into |2-5| two groups |6-7| , |8-8| according to |9-9| the website |10-11| ( |12-12| absolutely extraordinary |13-14| , for that matter |15-17| ) |18-18| The |19-19| Particle |20-20| Adventure |21-21| , |22-23| Berkeley |25-25| Laboratories |24-24| : |26-26| the |27-27| mesons |28-28| , |29-29| which we do not discuss |30-34| here |35-35| , |36-36| and |37-38| &quot; |39-39| forcibly |41-42| particles |40-40| , &quot; |43-44| by which |45-46| the major |47-48| forces of nature |49-52| are spreading |53-54| and |55-55| that |56-56| the |57-57| Higgs boson |58-60| would |61-61| somehow |62-64| related |65-65| . |66-66| 
 these |0-0| bosons |1-1| , |2-4| it |5-5| must be stressed |6-8| here |9-9| , |10-10| are not |11-13| all |14-15| bugs |16-16| as |17-17| exotic |18-18| as one might think |19-23| . |24-24| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| if you can |3-6| read |7-7| this column |8-9| , |10-10| it is thanks |11-13| to an |14-15| extraordinary |17-19| boson |16-16| banality |20-20| : |21-21| the photon |22-23| , |24-24| or |25-26| particle of light |28-30| &quot; |27-27| , &quot; which |31-32| is the |33-34| &quot; |35-35| messenger |36-36| &quot; |37-37| of the |38-39| electromagnetic |41-41| force |40-40| . |42-42| 
 when , |0-1| in fact |2-3| , |4-4| a particle |5-6| with |7-7| an electric charge |8-10| accelerates |11-11| or |12-12| changes direction |13-15| , this |16-17| &quot; |18-18| disturbed |19-19| &quot; |20-20| the electromagnetic field |21-23| in |24-24| this |25-25| specific location |26-27| , |28-28| a bit |29-30| like a stone thrown |31-34| into a pond |35-37| . |38-38| 
 this |0-1| &quot; |2-2| disturbance |3-3| &quot; |4-4| was born |5-5| an electromagnetic wave |6-8| ( |9-9| of light |10-12| or |13-14| infrared |15-17| or |18-20| ultraviolet , |21-23| etc . |24-24| ) |25-25| , |26-26| and |27-27| this |28-28| wave |29-29| is nothing more |30-34| than |35-35| a photon |36-37| - |38-38| and thus |39-40| , |41-41| one of the |42-43| boson |44-44| &quot; |45-45| with |46-47| force |48-48| . &quot; |49-50| 
 more stable |1-2| field |0-0| 
 the same is true |0-4| with the |5-6| Higgs boson |7-9| , with the difference |10-14| that |15-15| this is |16-17| another |18-19| field |20-20| , the |21-22| Higgs |24-25| field |23-23| , |26-26| which must |27-28| be |29-29| &quot; |30-30| disturbed |31-31| &quot; |32-32| that |33-34| the |35-35| boson |36-36| appears . |37-38| 
 however , |0-1| the |2-2| Higgs |4-5| field |3-3| is much |6-7| , |8-8| much more |9-10| stable than |11-12| the electromagnetic field |13-15| ; |16-16| pour l &apos;exciter |17-19| , there has to be |20-23| very |24-25| , |26-26| very |27-27| high energies |28-29| , |30-30| almost as if |31-34| it were a |35-39| frozen |41-41| pond |40-40| whose |42-42| only a |43-44| very |45-45| large rock |46-47| could |48-48| ride |49-49| the surface |50-51| . |52-52| 
 that is why |0-2| we need a |3-5| massive |6-6| such |10-11| particle accelerator |7-9| at CERN |12-13| , |14-14| the |15-15| Large Hadron |16-17| Collider |18-18| is |19-19| a ring |20-21| of |22-22| 27 |23-23| miles |24-24| in circumference |25-26| ! |27-27| - |28-28| to achieve |29-30| such |31-32| energies . |33-34| 
 the analogy |0-1| with |2-2| the electromagnetic field |3-5| is |6-6| useful again |7-9| to explain |10-11| the |12-12| relationship between |13-14| the |15-15| Higgs |16-16| and |17-17| the mass |18-19| . |20-20| 
 these |0-0| are not |1-5| all particles |6-8| , |9-9| or |10-10| all |11-12| materials , |13-14| interacting |15-16| with |17-17| the electromagnetic field |18-20| . |21-21| 
 some , like |0-2| the magnets |3-4| , |5-5| do , |6-8| but |9-9| others do not |10-12| - |13-13| a piece of paper |14-17| , |18-18| for example |19-20| , |21-21| does |22-22| not |24-25| hold |23-23| himself |26-28| on |29-29| a |30-30| fridge |31-31| . |32-32| 
 and |0-0| in the same way |1-4| , not |5-9| all particles |10-12| that interact |13-14| with the |15-16| Higgs |18-19| field |17-17| : |20-20| those |21-21| who |22-22| do |23-24| have |25-25| a mass |26-27| , |28-28| while |29-30| others |31-32| ( such as |33-34| the photon |35-36| , |37-37| want |38-38| ) |39-39| do not . |40-44| 
 now |0-0| , |1-1| what does |2-6| &quot; |7-7| can make |8-9| &quot; |10-10| all |11-11| this research |12-13| , asked |14-15| Senator Plamondon |16-17| ? |18-18| 
 for |0-0| science |1-2| , it |3-4| is used to |5-6| verify |7-7| the validity |8-9| of the |10-10| Standard Model |11-12| ( |13-13| MS |14-14| ) |15-15| , |16-16| and it |17-18| also allows |19-21| physicists |22-22| to |23-23| scrutinize |24-24| any |25-25| discrepancy |26-26| between observations |27-29| and |30-30| predictions |31-32| of the |33-33| MS |34-34| . |35-35| 
 they are |0-1| also |2-3| more |4-4| fervently |7-7| hope |5-6| that |8-8| this is |9-11| because |12-13| the slightest |14-15| difference |16-16| could open |17-18| a door |19-20| on |21-21| a |22-22| &quot; |23-23| new physics |24-25| &quot; and |26-27| plug |28-28| some |29-29| holes |30-30| in the Model |31-32| . |33-33| 
 the latter |0-2| , |3-3| it must be said , |4-8| still has |9-10| huge |11-12| shortcomings |13-13| , |14-15| offering |16-16| no explanation |17-18| for |19-19| the seriousness |20-21| ( |22-22| oops |23-23| ! |24-24| ) |25-25| or |26-26| the |27-27| dark matter |28-29| , which |30-31| form |32-32| about 80 |33-34| % |35-35| of the |36-37| matter in the Universe |38-41| ( re |42-43| @-@ |44-44| oops |45-45| ! |46-46| ) |47-47| . |48-48| 
 but we |0-1| found no |2-5| such differences |6-8| at CERN |9-10| until |11-12| now |13-13| . |14-14| 
 impact of |0-0| 
 the implications |0-1| of |2-2| this research |3-4| in |5-5| the daily lives |6-7| of Mr and Mrs |8-11| Tout @-@ |12-13| le @-@ |14-15| Monde , |16-17| they |18-18| are |19-20| more difficult to |21-23| predict |24-24| , |25-25| but |26-26| it would be wrong to |27-30| assume that |31-32| there |33-36| will be no |37-38| . |39-39| 
 hold |0-0| : |1-1| in the early |2-5| 1960s |6-7| , |8-8| the pioneers |9-10| of the laser |11-12| , |13-13| in the |14-15| Bell |17-17| Laboratories |16-16| , |18-18| did |19-19| not |21-21| suspect |20-20| the revolution |22-23| that |24-24| their work |25-26| would |27-27| trigger |28-28| . |29-29| 
 they |0-1| saw |2-2| the |3-3| scientific applications |4-5| , |6-6| but |7-7| nothing |8-8| of the rest |9-10| . |11-11| 
 in fact |0-1| , we |2-3| have already |4-5| said |6-6| the late |7-8| physicist |9-9| Willard |10-10| Boyle |11-11| - |12-12| who |13-13| worked |14-15| in the |16-17| Bell |18-18| Labs |19-19| , where |20-21| the laser |22-23| was invented |24-25| in 1960 |26-27| , |28-28| and |29-29| which |30-30| itself has |31-34| developed |35-37| the first |38-39| continuous |41-41| laser |40-40| ( |42-42| the first |43-44| was |45-45| pulsed |46-46| ) |47-47| , |48-48| in 1962 |49-50| , |51-52| the laser |55-56| was |57-58| initially |53-54| seen as |59-60| a |61-61| &quot; |62-62| lab |64-65| gadget |63-63| . &quot; |66-67| 
 imagine |0-0| . ... |1-1| 
 and |0-0| then |1-1| , applications |2-4| can |5-5| also come from |6-8| any |9-9| instrumentation |10-11| that surrounds |12-13| the research |14-15| . |16-16| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| the same |3-4| Willard |5-5| Boyle |6-6| has developed |7-10| a light sensor |11-15| in 1969 |16-17| , |18-18| during |19-21| its work |22-23| in optics |24-25| . |26-26| 
 this sensor |0-1| , |2-2| although |3-4| it was not |5-8| at all |9-10| its |11-11| original intent |12-13| , |14-14| now serves as |15-16| an &quot; |17-19| eye |20-20| &quot; |21-21| to |22-22| all |23-24| the world &apos;s |28-29| digital cameras |25-27| , |30-30| and |31-31| won |32-34| the |35-35| 2009 |39-39| Nobel Prize |36-36| in physics |37-38| . |40-40| 
 of course , |3-4| this does |0-2| not mean |5-6| that |7-7| the activities |8-9| of the LHC |10-11| will |12-12| necessarily |13-13| transform |14-14| our lives |15-16| , |17-17| but |18-18| it means |19-20| that , |21-22| really |23-23| , |24-24| you never know |25-28| ... |29-29|

 the debate |0-1| will |2-2| resume |3-3| shortly |4-5| , while a |6-8| bill |9-11| is preparing |12-13| . |14-14| 
 however , |0-1| in |2-2| this critical area |3-5| , |6-6| much remains to be done |7-10| . |11-11|

 it is precisely |0-2| this great |3-4| deficiency |5-5| in the |6-7| Quebec health |9-11| care |8-8| concerns |12-14| several |15-16| doctors who specialize |17-18| in |19-19| palliative |21-21| care , |20-20| the adoption |22-23| of a law |24-26| regulating |27-27| euthanasia |28-29| and |30-30| assisted suicide |31-33| . |34-34| 
 since October |0-4| , |5-5| a manifesto |6-7| , |8-8| signed |9-9| by |10-10| luminaries |11-11| of palliative care |12-14| , |15-15| Dr. |16-17| Balfour Mount |18-19| and |20-20| Dr. |21-22| Bernard |23-23| Lapointe |24-24| , |25-25| travels |26-26| to show their |27-30| opposition to |31-32| such an initiative |33-35| . |36-36| 
 according to |0-0| Dr. |1-2| Christiane |3-3| Martel |4-4| , the |5-6| Quebec health system |7-10| is not |11-13| powerful |15-15| enough |14-14| to ensure |16-17| that everyone |18-19| has |20-20| the right to |21-22| quality palliative care |23-27| before |28-29| agreeing |30-32| to perform |33-35| euthanasia |36-37| . |38-38|

 I fear |0-1| that |2-2| patients |3-4| do not |5-5| ask |6-6| to die |7-8| because they |9-12| do not receive |13-15| adequate |18-18| care |16-17| . |19-19| 
 and |0-0| at the same time , |1-2| several |3-3| oncologists |4-4| bent |5-6| on |7-7| their patients |8-9| until the |10-11| last day |12-13| , |14-14| despite |15-15| the worst |16-17| prognosis |18-18| . |19-19| 
 the hopes |0-1| of survival |2-3| of |4-4| Hélène |5-5| Richard |6-6| were already |7-8| minimal |9-9| when she |10-11| gave up |12-13| trying |16-16| chemotherapy |14-15| . |17-17| 
 when I announced |0-3| to |4-4| my |5-5| oncologist |6-6| that |7-7| I would have to stop |8-9| treatment |10-11| , she |12-13| told me |14-16| that she |17-18| regretted |19-19| that |20-20| I stop |21-22| to |23-23| beat me |24-25| , |26-26| &quot; she |27-31| said |32-32| . |33-33|

 at the very end |0-3| of |4-4| life , |5-7| doctors |8-9| often |10-12| use |13-14| palliative sedation |15-17| , which |18-19| amounts to |20-21| lull |22-22| the patient |23-24| until the |25-26| time of |27-28| his death |29-30| , |31-32| sporadically |33-35| , or |36-37| permanently |38-40| . |41-41| 
 we can no longer |0-3| pretend |4-5| not to hear |6-9| that part |10-13| of |14-14| the suffering |15-16| . |17-17| 
 increasingly |0-3| , |4-4| the patient |5-6| not |7-7| relieved |8-8| will |9-9| have the opportunity |10-12| to have |13-14| this |15-15| palliative |17-17| sedation |16-16| . |18-18|

 the next |0-1| on |2-2| the list |3-4| would be |5-5| Gilles |6-6| Vaillancourt |7-7| , |8-8| who comes |9-10| to resign |11-12| from his post as |13-16| mayor of |17-18| Laval , |19-20| Quebec &apos;s |23-24| third largest city |21-22| . |25-25|

 in Montreal |0-1| , the |2-3| &quot; system &quot; |4-6| of corruption |7-8| was functioning smoothly |9-10| . |11-11| 
 Gilles |0-0| Surprenant |1-1| , |2-2| former |3-4| public works |7-8| engineer |5-6| , |9-9| has |10-11| detailed |13-13| well |12-12| before |14-14| the committee |15-16| : |17-17| in |18-18| 10 years |19-20| , |21-21| he received |22-24| gifts |29-29| of construction companies |25-28| , |30-30| invitations to |31-32| travel |33-34| , golf tournaments |35-38| , |39-39| restaurants , |40-41| hockey games |42-44| and |45-45| bribes |46-50| totaling |51-51| $ |54-54| 736,000 |52-53| , |55-55| in exchange for |56-58| sewer |60-61| contracts |59-59| which he |62-63| exaggerated the |64-65| costs . |66-67| 
 other |0-1| road |3-5| officials |2-2| have |6-6| confessed |7-7| having |8-10| grease |11-11| the leg |12-13| by pumping up |14-15| to |16-16| 30 |17-17| % |18-18| to 40 |19-20| % |21-21| invoices |22-23| , |24-25| false |26-27| extras |28-28| . |29-29| 
 then |0-0| an organizer |1-2| of the |3-3| mayor &apos;s |5-6| party |4-4| , |7-7| Martin |8-8| Dumont |9-9| , |10-10| accused |11-12| Mr. |13-13| Tremblay |14-14| of deliberately |15-17| turned a blind |18-19| eye to |20-21| a |22-22| parallel |24-24| budget |23-23| fueling |25-25| its |26-26| coffers |27-27| with |28-29| dirty money |30-32| . |33-33| 
 following these |0-4| revelations |5-5| , |6-6| Mr. |7-7| Tremblay |8-8| resigned |9-10| in early November |11-12| , plunging |13-14| Montreal |15-15| in a |16-17| major crisis |18-19| . |20-20| 
 Chantal |0-0| Rouleau |1-1| was |2-3| one of the first |4-7| elected |8-8| from Montreal to |9-11| sound the alarm |12-16| . |17-17|

 the investigation |0-2| , which |3-3| will eventually be |4-5| put |6-6| in place |7-8| , she |9-10| said |11-11| that she |12-13| &quot; |14-14| takes |15-15| on |16-16| a wire |17-18| to |19-20| understand |21-21| the functioning |22-23| of the system |24-25| , |26-26| infiltrated |27-27| by |28-28| ants |29-30| , |31-31| to stop |32-33| gangrene |34-35| and |36-36| nabbing |37-37| wrongdoers |38-39| . &quot; |40-41| 
 the process |0-1| , |2-2| she said , |3-6| is &quot; |7-8| painful |9-9| but positive |10-11| . &quot; |12-13| 
 it |0-0| is about to clean |1-5| the wound |6-7| but |8-8| there should be |9-10| a |11-11| proper |15-15| investigation unit |12-14| in Montreal |16-17| and |18-18| a watch |19-20| , not to |21-24| see |25-25| the return of |26-27| dubious practices |28-29| . |30-30| 
 as |0-1| the |2-3| household . |4-5| 
 regularly |0-0| . &quot; |1-1| 
 Jacques |0-0| Duchesneau |1-1| notes |2-2| that |3-6| &quot; |7-7| officials |8-9| stole |10-11| hundreds |12-13| of millions |14-15| of dollars |16-17| , &quot; |18-19| but |20-20| expressed particular concern about |21-23| the role |24-25| of &quot; |26-28| elected |29-29| aware |30-31| of the |32-32| scheme |33-33| , &quot; |34-35| when they |36-37| don |38-38| &apos;t |40-40| dipped |39-39| in |41-41| deception |42-43| ! |44-44| 
 believing |0-0| at |1-1| 70 |2-2| % share |3-5| of |6-6| dirty money |7-8| in |9-9| the financing |10-11| of election campaigns |12-14| in Quebec |15-16| , |17-18| &quot; says |19-19| : |20-20| &quot; |21-21| I was told that |22-26| it was only |27-30| a |31-31| pale reflection |32-33| of reality |34-36| . &quot; |37-38| 
 the Quebec government |0-2| is proposing |3-3| to limit |4-5| to |6-6| $ 100 |7-8| donations |9-10| to parties |11-12| , but it |13-14| will not change |15-17| the situation |18-19| , |20-20| he said |21-22| : |23-23| &quot; |24-24| as long as we |25-27| do |28-28| not strictly |30-31| limit |29-29| election spending |32-34| , |35-35| there will be |36-39| dirty money |40-42| in politics |43-44| . &quot; |45-46| 
 it |0-0| calls for |1-1| a |2-2| complete overhaul |3-4| of the system |5-6| of |7-7| awarding |8-9| public contracts |10-11| and financing |12-14| of parties |15-16| : |17-17| &quot; you can &apos;t |18-22| go |23-23| lower |24-25| and |26-26| get to the bottom of |27-30| things , |31-32| with courage |33-34| , |35-35| will help to |36-37| rebuild |38-38| the house |39-40| on a firmer footing |41-45| , |46-46| with |47-47| more controls |48-50| and |51-52| laws |53-53| . &quot; |54-55| 
 if |0-0| this story |1-2| has tarnished the |3-4| international image |5-6| of Quebec |7-8| and |9-10| Montreal , |11-12| Mr. Duchesneau |13-14| invites |15-15| those who |16-18| laugh |19-19| to |20-20| look in |21-22| their |23-23| own backyard |24-25| ... |26-26| 
 &quot; |0-0| PSG |1-2| is not the |3-6| FC |7-7| Barcelona |8-8| ! |9-9| &quot; |10-10| 
 this season |0-1| , |2-2| you have |3-4| taken |5-5| a new |6-7| scale |8-8| with PSG |9-11| . |12-12| 
 how do you explain |0-3| this progression |4-5| ? |6-6| 
 this can be explained by |0-4| an |5-5| individual awareness |6-9| , but also |10-11| by |12-12| the |13-13| new dimension |14-15| of the |16-16| PSG . |17-18| 
 great |0-1| players |2-2| arrived |3-4| . |5-5| 
 every day |0-1| , I |2-3| is |4-4| at |5-5| their side |6-7| . |8-8| 
 the |0-0| technical staff |1-2| also |5-5| contributed a great deal |6-7| to me |3-4| . |8-8| 
 on a daily basis |0-1| , |2-2| these elements |3-4| lead me |5-6| to |7-7| raise |8-8| my |9-9| level of play |10-12| . |13-13| 
 and |0-0| , |1-1| in a |2-2| match , |3-4| it is |5-6| easier |7-8| . |9-9| 
 everything is |0-1| very quickly |2-3| in football |4-6| . |7-7| 
 but |0-0| I do |1-3| not |5-5| ignite |4-4| . |6-6| 
 in |0-0| my early days |1-2| at the centre |3-4| of |5-5| the |7-8| INF |9-9| Clairefontaine |10-10| preformation |6-6| in |11-11| my visit |12-13| to |14-14| Saint |15-15| @-@ |16-16| Etienne |17-17| , |18-18| I have |19-20| always |21-21| put forward by |22-23| levels |24-24| . |25-25| 
 therefore , |2-2| you take |0-1| advantage of |3-4| competition |5-6| installed |7-7| by |8-8| Carlo |9-9| Ancelotti |10-10| ... |11-11| 
 this summer &apos;s |2-4| recruits |0-1| are |5-5| accustomed to |6-7| play games |8-10| at a very high level |11-14| . |15-15| 
 they |0-0| also know |1-2| that each |3-4| training |5-5| is crucial |6-7| . |8-8| 
 what makes |0-2| a player |3-5| like me |6-7| want |8-9| to respond |10-12| and |13-13| to provide |14-15| the maximum |16-17| . |18-18| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| Carlo |3-3| Ancelotti |4-4| brings me a lot |5-7| about |8-9| my |10-10| position . |11-12| 
 he |0-0| is supported |1-2| by |3-4| deputies |5-5| as |6-6| Claude |7-7| Makelele |8-8| , |9-9| who |10-10| played |11-11| in the |12-12| same position |13-14| as me |15-16| . |17-17| 
 Ancelotti |0-0| is |1-3| the man for the job |4-8| ? |9-9| 
 of course |0-1| . |2-2| 
 Ancelotti |0-0| inspires |1-1| respect |2-3| among |4-4| all technicians |5-7| . |8-8| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| he |3-3| has no |4-7| equal |8-8| in |9-9| Ligue |10-10| 1 and |11-12| is one |13-14| of the best |15-16| coaches |17-17| in Europe . |18-19| 
 he has |0-1| a great |2-3| experience and |4-5| won |6-7| a lot of |8-9| titles |10-10| with |11-11| clubs |12-13| huppés |14-14| . |15-15| 
 he |0-1| worked with |2-2| great |3-4| players . |5-6| 
 I think he |0-3| will win |4-4| other |5-6| titles |7-7| in Paris |8-9| . |10-10| 
 in January |0-1| , |2-2| I had |3-5| a |6-6| comforting |8-8| discussion |7-7| with him |9-10| . |11-11| 
 then |2-2| I went out |0-1| of a series |3-5| of injuries |6-7| . |8-8| 
 it |2-3| gives me |4-5| confidence |0-1| also explains |6-7| my performance |8-9| . |10-10| 
 what is your view |0-4| on the |5-6| first part |7-8| of |9-9| the season ? |10-13| 
 in |0-0| Ligue |1-1| 1 |2-2| , |3-3| Lyon |4-4| we |5-5| took |6-7| the |8-8| leading position |9-11| . |12-12| 
 but |0-0| we remain |1-2| in |3-3| ambush |4-4| . |5-5| 
 one of our |0-2| major |4-4| goals |3-3| is |5-5| the Champions League |6-9| : |10-10| we have |11-13| qualified for |14-15| the |16-16| quarter @-@ final |17-19| with |20-20| the |21-21| way . |22-23| 
 what is |0-1| the objective |2-3| of the club |4-5| in |6-6| this competition |7-8| ? |9-9| 
 are |0-0| going to try |1-2| to |3-3| go as far as possible |4-8| . |9-9| 
 now |0-0| , |1-1| anything can happen |2-4| . |5-5| 
 but we |0-1| will have |2-2| our say |3-6| in |7-8| very good |9-11| European teams |12-13| . |14-14| 
 firstly , we want to |0-3| finish |4-4| first |5-5| in our |6-7| pool |8-8| , to |9-10| Porto |11-11| , |12-12| in order to |13-14| receive |15-15| at the |16-17| 8th |18-18| final |20-20| &apos;s |19-19| return |21-21| . |22-22| 
 can PSG |0-4| become |5-5| a major |6-7| European club |8-9| in the short |10-11| term ? |12-13| 
 it |0-1| has already |2-3| the budget |4-5| ... |6-6| 
 in order to become |0-1| a major |2-3| European club |4-5| , Paris |6-7| needs |8-9| to win |10-11| titles |12-13| and |14-15| register |16-17| . |18-21| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| this is not |3-6| the case |7-8| . |9-9| 
 financially |0-0| , PSG |1-3| gives itself |4-5| the means |6-7| to make |8-9| this project |10-11| happen . |12-14| 
 in |0-0| Ligue |1-1| 1 |2-2| , |3-3| not |4-5| win |6-6| the title |7-8| , |9-9| as |10-10| last season |11-13| , |14-14| would be |15-15| a big |16-17| failure ? |18-19| 
 of course |0-1| , |2-2| this would be |3-4| a |5-5| big disappointment |6-7| . |8-8| 
 this year |0-1| , |2-2| it was |3-4| really |5-5| committed |6-7| to pocket |8-9| the |10-10| title of |11-12| champion |13-13| . |14-14| 
 last season |0-2| , it |3-4| is not |5-7| gone |8-8| away . |9-10| 
 in May |0-1| , |2-2| there was |3-6| disappointment |7-9| because |10-10| we |11-11| had |12-12| the qualities |13-14| to finish |15-16| first |17-17| . |18-18| 
 it |0-0| made a |1-3| very |4-4| big |5-5| season . |6-7| 
 it |0-0| finished |1-2| with |3-3| 79 |4-4| points . |5-6| 
 normally , |0-1| with |2-2| 79 |3-3| points |4-4| , it |5-6| is supposed to |7-8| be |9-9| champion |10-10| ... |11-11| 
 but |0-0| another |1-2| team , |3-4| Montpellier |5-5| , |6-6| has made |7-8| a season |9-10| even more |11-12| fantastic . |13-14| 
 this year |0-1| , I |2-3| think it |4-6| is the right one . |7-10| 
 even if |0-1| the big |2-3| teams |4-4| like |5-5| Marseille |6-6| , |7-7| Lyon |8-8| or |9-9| Bordeaux |10-10| are |11-11| in |12-12| the fight |13-14| for |15-15| the title |16-17| , I |18-19| think |20-21| it |22-22| has |23-23| the weapons |24-25| to |26-26| win |27-28| . |29-29| 
 do you think |0-3| the media |4-5| expect too much |6-7| of the PSG |8-9| ? |10-10| 
 it is |0-1| normal that |2-3| you expect |4-5| a lot from us |6-8| in the light |9-10| of what |11-13| was |14-15| invested |16-16| and the |17-18| players |19-19| we have . |20-22| 
 we |0-0| accept it |1-2| . |3-4| 
 later , |0-1| when we |2-3| won |4-4| 4 |5-5| @-@ |6-6| 0 |7-7| at home |8-9| against |10-10| Troyes |11-11| and that |12-13| there are still |14-16| things |17-18| to |19-19| blame us |20-21| , |22-22| it is |23-24| certain that |25-26| it is a |27-29| bit frustrating |30-31| . |32-32| 
 one wonders |0-2| what people |3-6| expect |7-8| more |9-9| . |10-10| 
 we |0-0| will never |1-3| win |4-4| 4 |5-5| @-@ |6-6| 0 |7-7| every weekend |8-12| . |13-13| 
 it |0-0| is not the |1-4| FC |5-5| Barcelona |6-6| ! |7-7| 
 we &apos;re trying |0-1| to put |2-3| in place |4-5| a project |6-7| . |8-10| 
 a team |0-1| is built over time |2-6| . |7-7| 
 it was |0-1| shown |2-2| in |3-3| Champions |5-6| League |4-4| that |7-7| we could |8-9| respond |10-10| . |11-12| 
 look at |0-0| Manchester |1-1| City |2-2| that |3-3| does not happen |4-6| , |7-7| for the past two |8-9| seasons |10-10| , |11-11| to |12-12| qualify |13-14| for the |15-16| quarter @-@ final |17-19| , |20-20| they also |21-23| made huge |24-26| expenses |27-27| ! |28-28| 
 in terms |0-1| of the |2-2| money invested |3-4| , |5-5| you |6-7| imagined |8-8| with |9-9| 15 points |10-11| ahead |12-13| in |14-14| the truce |15-16| . |17-17| 
 it was |0-1| neglecting |2-2| our opponents |3-4| and |5-5| the championship |6-7| of |8-8| France |9-9| . |10-10| 
 Lyon |0-0| and |1-1| Marseille |2-2| , |3-3| who |4-4| were not |5-7| well |8-8| last season |9-11| , |12-12| were |13-14| inspired by |15-18| this new |19-20| PSG . |21-22| 
 this shows |0-1| that |2-2| the League |3-4| 1 |5-5| is |6-6| exciting . |7-8| 
 I hope |0-1| that |2-2| in the month |3-4| of |5-5| May |6-6| we can |7-8| have |9-9| a smile |10-11| by telling us |12-14| that , |15-16| despite |17-17| all the difficulties |18-20| , it |21-22| eventually prevailed |23-27| . |28-28| 
 PSG |0-1| seems |2-2| totally |3-3| dependent on the |4-5| exploits of |6-7| Zlatan |8-8| Ibrahimovic |9-9| . |10-10| 
 all the better |0-1| that |2-2| it |3-3| says |4-4| that there is a |5-9| &quot; |10-10| Zlatan |11-11| dependence |12-12| . &quot; |13-14| 
 this means |0-2| that |3-3| Ibrahimovic |4-4| is very |5-6| powerful |7-7| and |8-8| it |9-10| puts |11-11| a lot of |12-13| goals . |14-15| 
 he came |0-2| to |3-3| that and |4-5| it proves |6-7| that he |8-9| is the |10-11| star |12-12| of |13-13| the League |14-15| 1 |16-16| . |17-17| 
 he |0-0| demonstrated |1-2| wherever |3-4| he |5-5| went |6-7| he |8-9| was a |10-11| great player |12-13| , |14-14| a |15-15| global |17-17| star |16-16| . |18-18| 
 within the group |0-3| , |4-4| we respect |5-6| the man |7-8| and |9-9| the player |10-11| . |12-12| 
 he |0-0| also |1-1| respects the |2-3| men |4-4| he has |5-7| around him |8-10| . |11-11| 
 what he has done |0-4| is |5-5| truly exceptional . |6-8| 
 it |0-0| pushes |1-1| others to |2-4| raise |5-5| their level |6-7| of play |8-9| . |10-10| 
 Thiago |0-0| Silva |1-1| , |2-2| who |3-3| is |4-4| one of the |5-7| best defenders |8-9| in the world |10-11| , |12-12| also allows |13-15| everyone |16-18| to move |19-20| . |21-21| 
 how did you |0-3| lived |4-4| the Euro |5-6| 2012 |7-7| with the French team |8-12| ? |13-13| 
 as |0-0| a disappointment |1-2| . |3-3| 
 I had |0-1| committed |2-3| to participate |4-5| in this |6-7| Euro |8-8| . |9-9| 
 unfortunately , |0-1| my injury |2-3| prevented me from |4-7| claw |8-8| game time |9-12| . |13-13| 
 I saw |0-2| things |3-4| there and |5-8| I |9-10| am |11-11| emerged stronger |12-13| . |14-14| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| I can |3-5| achieve |6-6| good |7-8| matches |9-10| . |11-12| 
 this is what |0-3| I was hoping |4-5| for |6-6| my |7-7| baptism |8-8| with |9-9| the Blues |10-11| . |12-12| 
 it was |0-1| learned the lessons |2-4| from |5-5| what happened |6-10| in Ukraine |11-12| and |13-15| now needs |16-18| to have |19-20| an |21-21| exemplary behaviour |22-23| . |24-24| 
 what is your view |0-4| on |5-5| the first few months |6-8| of |9-9| Didier |10-10| Deschamps |11-11| à la |12-13| tête |14-14| des |15-15| Bleus |16-16| ? |17-17| 
 has |0-1| the results |2-3| for him |4-5| . |6-6| 
 it |0-0| is well |1-2| placed in |3-4| the group |5-6| qualifier for |7-8| the |9-9| World Cup |10-10| . |11-11| 
 the breeder |0-1| is rigorous |2-3| , |4-4| close to the |5-6| players , |7-8| and inspires |9-10| the |11-11| wins . |12-13| 
 as |0-1| was |2-2| Laurent |3-3| Blanc |4-4| . |5-5| 
 but |0-0| I don &apos;t want to |1-4| make |5-6| comparison . |7-8| 
 white |0-0| had |1-1| achieved its |2-3| goal |4-4| in |5-6| qualifying |7-7| for |8-8| the Euro |9-10| . |11-11| 
 I hope |0-1| that |2-2| Didier |3-3| Deschamps |4-4| will lead |5-5| the Blues |6-7| in Brazil |8-9| . |10-10| 
 the |0-0| good |1-1| one |2-2| ( |3-3| 1 |4-4| @-@ 1 |5-6| ) |7-7| snatched |8-8| on 16 |9-11| October |12-12| , Spain |13-15| is |16-16| a |17-21| founding |23-23| game |22-22| ? |24-24| 
 this match |0-1| gave us |2-4| confidence . |5-6| 
 each |0-0| has fought for |1-4| everyone |5-7| . |8-8| 
 prior to |0-0| this clash |1-2| in Spain |3-4| , |5-5| I had never |6-9| experienced |10-11| such a |13-13| match |12-12| in |14-14| my career |15-16| . |17-17| 
 with |0-0| bitcoin |1-1| , |2-2| pay |3-3| and |4-4| sell |5-5| without |6-6| banks |7-8| 
 the opposite |0-2| of the |3-3| current |6-6| monetary exchange |4-5| , |7-7| based on |8-9| central banks |10-12| , |13-14| transactions identified |15-16| and |17-18| processing fees |19-21| among stakeholders |22-25| . |26-26| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| as is often the case |3-4| in |5-5| these technologies |6-7| , |8-8| a |9-9| political vision |10-11| is palpable |12-13| : |14-14| the |15-15| belief |16-16| that the |17-18| current |21-21| monetary system |19-20| , made |22-23| of |24-24| banking |26-26| monopolies |25-25| , |27-27| led |28-28| to financial crises |29-31| . |32-32| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| bitcoin |3-3| , |4-4| invented |5-5| by |6-6| Satoshi |7-7| Nakamoto |8-8| ( |9-9| a pseudonym |10-11| ) |12-12| , |13-13| is both |14-17| a |18-18| virtual currency |19-20| ( |21-21| but |22-22| convertible into |23-24| dollars |25-25| , |26-26| euros |27-27| ... |28-28| ) |29-29| and |30-30| a |31-31| secure |35-35| exchange protocol |32-34| in |36-36| the manner |37-38| of |39-39| BitTorrent , |40-41| which |42-42| enables |43-43| the exchange |44-45| of |46-46| peer @-@ to @-@ peer |48-51| files |47-47| . |52-52| 
 about 200 |0-1| 000 |2-2| transactions have |3-4| already |5-5| been registered |6-7| with |8-9| 15,000 |10-11| computers |12-12| on |13-13| the network |14-15| . |16-16| 
 a |0-0| few |1-1| thousand |2-3| Web sites |4-5| accept |6-7| bitcoins |8-8| as |9-9| gifts |10-10| or |11-11| as a means |12-13| of payment |14-15| . |16-16| 
 the price of |0-2| bitcoin |3-3| , |4-4| after reaching |5-7| a peak of |8-10| 30 |11-11| dollars ( |12-13| 23 |14-14| euros |15-15| ) |16-16| in June |17-18| 2011 |19-19| , |20-20| fell |21-22| to |23-23| $ 2 |24-25| , five |26-27| months later |28-30| , before returning |31-34| today |35-36| around a |37-39| dozen |40-41| dollars ( |42-43| courses are |44-46| listed |47-47| on |48-48| the site |49-50| bitcoincharts.com |51-51| ) |52-52| . |53-53| 
 nothing |0-1| very impressive |2-3| , |4-4| compared |5-5| to the |6-6| global trade |7-8| in |9-9| real |11-11| currency |10-10| or |12-13| financial products |14-15| . |16-16| 
 yet , |0-1| the |2-2| European Central |4-5| Bank |3-3| ( ECB |6-7| ) |8-8| is |9-11| interested |12-12| in |13-13| a report |14-15| on the |16-17| virtual |19-19| currencies |18-18| published |20-20| in October |21-22| . |23-23| 
 she |0-0| describes |1-1| as &quot; |3-4| the |5-5| virtual currency |6-7| bitcoin |2-2| having |8-8| the most success |9-12| , &quot; |13-14| &quot; |15-15| in competition |16-17| with |18-18| the dollar |19-20| or |21-21| the euro |22-23| &quot; and |24-25| &quot; similar |26-27| to |28-29| conventional currencies |30-31| . &quot; |32-33| 
 bitcoin |0-0| differs from other |1-4| types of |5-6| virtual currency |7-8| as |9-9| the |10-10| &quot; |11-11| credits |12-12| &quot; |13-14| used to |15-16| move forward in |17-18| a video game |19-21| is won |22-25| by playing |26-27| or |28-28| that you can |29-32| buy |33-33| ( |34-34| and sometimes |35-36| share |37-37| in return |38-39| ) |40-40| . |41-41| 
 the |0-0| social network |1-2| Facebook |3-3| has |4-4| also developed |5-6| this type |7-8| of |9-9| system . |10-11| 
 but |0-1| each time |2-3| , |4-4| a central authority |5-7| control and |8-9| trade |11-12| deals |10-10| . |13-13| 
 with |0-0| bitcoin |1-1| , |2-2| all nodes |3-5| of the network |6-7| are the |8-11| custodians |12-12| of the book |13-14| of accounts |15-16| , |17-17| auditors |18-18| , |19-19| money |21-22| transmitters |20-20| , |23-23| and |24-24| buyers and |25-26| sellers |27-27| . |28-28| 
 how does |0-1| this network |2-3| ? |4-4| 
 each transaction |0-1| between |2-2| two users |3-4| is |5-6| actually |7-8| between |9-9| two |10-10| e @-@ mail addresses |11-12| in the manner of |13-16| an e |17-18| @-@ mail |19-20| . |21-21| 
 except |0-0| that a |1-2| user can |3-4| choose |5-5| a different address |6-8| for each |9-10| payment , |11-12| thus ensuring |13-14| anonymity |15-16| . |17-17| 
 a set |0-1| of information |2-3| related to |4-5| this transaction |6-7| is |8-8| electronically signed |9-10| by a |11-12| dual @-@ |16-17| key |18-18| encryption |14-15| system |13-13| . |19-19| 
 the network |0-1| can |2-3| verify |4-4| the authenticity |5-6| of |7-7| the transaction |8-9| . |10-10| 
 thanks to the |0-1| contents |2-2| of the file |3-4| , it |5-6| is also |7-8| possible to |9-10| ensure |11-12| that the |13-14| bitcoins |15-15| traded |16-16| exist |17-18| in |19-19| the book |20-21| of |22-22| public |24-24| accounts |23-23| , |25-25| distributed |26-26| throughout |27-28| the network |29-30| . |31-31| 
 the |0-0| key step |1-3| is to |4-5| write |6-6| this new |7-8| transaction in |9-10| this book |11-12| . |13-13| 
 it |0-0| goes through |1-2| the resolution |3-4| of a |5-6| mathematical |8-8| challenge |7-7| launched |9-9| to computers |10-11| , |12-12| and |13-14| the winner |15-16| , a sort |17-18| of |19-19| provisional |22-22| central banker |20-21| , |23-23| will have |24-24| the privilege |25-26| to add |27-28| this line |29-30| . |31-32| 
 this is a |0-4| file |8-9| hash |6-7| phase |5-5| , that is |10-13| to say , |14-17| a large file |19-22| transformation |18-18| into a |23-24| digital |26-26| footprint |25-25| shorter |27-28| and |29-29| unique . |30-31| 
 &quot; |2-2| computers |0-1| are |3-3| &quot; |4-4| the new |5-6| transaction |7-7| and |8-9| add |10-10| a |11-11| number |12-12| of |13-14| &quot; |15-15| chop |16-16| &quot; |17-17| the whole |18-19| . |20-20| 
 the aim |0-1| is |2-2| to find |3-4| the number |5-6| that gives |7-8| a |9-9| unique |11-11| footprint |10-10| ( |12-12| a lot of |13-14| zeros |15-15| at the beginning |16-17| ) |18-18| . |19-19| 
 once |0-1| this number |2-3| found |4-4| , |5-5| other |6-7| knots |8-8| easily |10-10| check |9-9| that |11-11| it is |12-13| the right one . |14-16| 
 the transaction |0-1| is |2-3| then |4-4| indestructiblement |5-5| linked to |6-7| the chain |8-9| of all |10-13| other |14-14| transactions |15-15| ; |16-16| any amendment |17-18| would change |19-19| the footprint |20-21| . |22-22| 
 if |0-0| , |1-1| to |2-2| defraud |3-3| , |4-4| a user |5-6| wanted to |7-7| pay twice |8-10| with |11-11| the same |12-13| money |14-14| very quickly |15-16| ( |17-17| less than |18-19| ten minutes |20-21| ) |22-22| , |23-23| one |24-25| of the two |26-27| transactions |28-28| would be |29-29| validated by |30-31| the network |32-33| - |34-34| the other |35-36| remaining |37-37| an orphan |38-38| because |39-39| the two |40-41| have |42-42| different |45-45| fingerprints |43-44| . |46-46| 
 the computer |0-1| has |2-2| solved the |3-4| challenge |5-5| won |6-6| 50 |7-7| bitcoins |8-8| . |9-9| 
 to avoid |0-1| inflation |2-3| , |4-4| this award |5-6| is |7-7| divided by |8-9| two |10-10| regularly , |11-12| probably before |13-14| the |15-15| end of 2012 |16-17| . |18-18| 
 the number |0-1| of |2-2| bitcoins |3-3| in circulation |4-5| is |6-7| limited to |8-9| 21 |10-10| million |11-11| , |12-12| but |13-13| they are |14-15| divisible |16-16| until |17-18| one hundred |19-19| millionth |20-20| , leaving |21-24| the |25-26| room |27-27| ... |28-28| 
 the difficulty |0-1| of the challenge |2-3| is also |4-5| raised to |6-7| each |8-8| increase in |9-10| computing power |11-14| . |15-15| 
 life |0-1| of the network |2-3| has already had |4-6| its ups and downs |7-11| . |12-12| 
 Web sites |0-2| providing services |3-5| for |6-6| bitcoin |7-7| were attacked |8-10| and |11-12| stolen |16-16| bitcoins |13-13| in |14-14| deposits |15-15| . |17-17| 
 &quot; |0-0| the fault |1-2| used |3-3| does not concern |4-6| the protocol |7-8| itself |9-11| , &quot; says |12-14| Pierre |15-15| Noizat |16-16| , |17-17| who |18-18| has just launched |19-21| Paymium |22-22| , |23-23| a company |24-25| to pay |26-27| in |28-28| real |29-29| money |30-30| using the |31-32| bitcoin |34-34| network |33-33| . |35-35| 
 the ECB |0-1| also identifies |2-4| opportunities for |5-7| money laundering |8-10| through |11-12| this |13-13| anonymous service |14-15| . |16-16| 
 but |0-0| the cash |1-2| also has |3-4| this defect |5-6| . |7-7| 
 players |0-3| such as |4-4| Wikipedia |5-5| refuse |6-6| donations |7-8| of |9-9| this nature |10-11| . |12-12| 
 others , like |0-3| the |4-4| blogging |8-9| platform |5-7| WordPress |10-10| , |11-12| accept |13-13| . |14-14| 
 recently , |0-1| Dorit |5-5| Ron |6-6| and |4-4| Adi Shamir |2-3| of |7-8| the |9-9| Weizmann |11-11| Institute |10-10| in Israel |12-13| , have |14-15| analyzed |16-16| the book |17-18| of accounts |19-20| and showed |21-22| that almost 80 |23-26| % of the |27-28| bitcoins |29-29| do not circulate |30-32| . |33-33| 
 in November |0-1| , |2-3| &quot; |4-4| giants |6-6| &quot; |7-7| balances |5-5| have |8-8| been launched |9-10| . |11-11| 
 &quot; |0-0| thirty |1-1| thousand dollars |2-3| were |4-5| exchanged |6-6| , &quot; says |7-10| Jon |11-11| Holmquist , |12-13| who works for |14-16| Coinabul |17-17| , |18-18| which |19-19| converts |20-21| bitcoins |22-22| into gold |23-24| . |25-25| 
 Pierre |0-0| Noizat |1-1| , |2-2| author of |3-5| a book |6-7| on |8-9| the currency |10-11| , |12-12| firmly believes |13-14| in the potential |15-16| of |17-17| this technology |18-19| as a network |20-23| of transactions |24-25| . |26-26| 
 its system |0-1| , |2-2| Paytunia |3-3| , |4-4| is |5-5| equivalent to |6-7| a credit card |8-11| ( in |12-13| real |14-14| money |15-15| ) |16-16| or |17-18| a |19-19| contactless |23-24| mobile |22-22| payment |20-21| , |25-25| but |26-26| he uses |27-28| bitcoin |29-29| to validate |30-31| transactions |32-33| , which |34-35| are |36-36| less |37-38| expensive . |39-40| 
 the holder |0-1| manages |2-2| over |3-4| his identity |5-6| and |7-7| can therefore |8-9| be anonymous |10-11| . |12-12| 
 the system |0-1| is easy |2-3| to |4-4| implement |5-7| in |8-8| the merchants |9-10| , |11-11| who |12-12| do not need |13-16| to install |17-18| new |19-20| terminals |21-21| or |22-22| software . |23-24| 
 it is sufficient to |0-3| provide |4-4| an address |5-6| that a |7-8| phone can |9-10| &quot; |11-11| photograph |12-12| and |13-13| recognize |14-14| , &quot; |15-16| said |17-17| Pierre |18-18| Noizat |19-19| , which |20-21| claims to have |22-23| thousands |24-25| of users |26-27| . |28-28| 
 there is a |0-3| general movement |4-5| of |6-6| questioning the |7-10| hierarchical |12-12| systems |11-11| for |13-14| more horizontal |16-17| systems |15-15| . |18-18| 
 &quot; |0-0| it |1-1| will take time for |2-6| bitcoin |7-7| is needed |8-9| , |10-10| but |11-11| 2013 |12-12| could |13-13| be |14-14| a turning point |15-16| , &quot; |17-18| he predicts . |19-22| 
 the ECB |0-1| , |2-2| in |3-3| his report |4-5| , |6-6| also |8-9| plans |7-7| to re @-@ evaluate the |10-12| various |14-14| risks |13-13| , |15-15| today |16-17| considered |18-19| high , |20-21| in the event |22-23| of |24-24| success of |25-26| this |27-27| currency . |28-29| 
 we started |0-2| from Afghanistan |3-4| . |5-5| 
 and after |0-1| ? |2-2| 
 French troops |0-2| have left |3-4| their |5-5| area of responsibility |6-8| in Afghanistan |9-10| ( |11-11| Kapisa |12-12| and |13-13| Surobi |14-14| ) |15-15| . |16-16| 
 NATO |0-1| and |2-2| the Americans |3-4| should follow |5-6| by the end of 2014 |7-8| . |9-9| 
 it is time for |0-3| the Afghan army |4-6| to |9-9| reclaim |7-8| its territory |10-11| and that |12-13| Afghans |14-15| choose |16-16| their future |17-18| , |19-19| without |20-20| any |21-21| expect from |22-23| us . |24-25| 
 these are |0-1| mainly |2-2| Afghan farmers |3-5| that |6-6| we |7-8| punished |9-9| by considering them |10-12| as terrorists |13-15| . |16-16| 
 and |0-0| ourselves |1-3| , |4-4| with our |5-6| 88 |7-7| soldiers killed |8-9| , |10-10| and |11-11| the wounded , |12-15| mutilated |16-16| . |17-17| 
 the Taliban |0-1| are composed |2-3| of |4-4| foreign |6-6| extremists |5-5| , |7-7| former heads |8-10| refugees |11-11| in Pakistan |12-13| , |14-14| but |15-15| often |16-17| peasants |18-18| who refuse |19-20| the |21-21| foreign |24-24| military |23-23| presence |22-22| , such as |25-26| the time |27-28| of the |29-29| Soviets |30-30| . |31-31| 
 they want to |0-1| defend |2-2| their traditions |3-4| , |5-5| ancient |6-6| and |7-7| archaic |8-8| , even |9-10| if they |11-12| were |13-14| joined by |15-17| jihadists |18-18| , Pakistani |19-20| , Arab |21-22| , Uzbek |23-24| , Tajik |25-26| . |27-27| 
 tolerated |0-0| , sometimes |1-2| aided by |3-4| local |7-7| insurgents |5-6| , |8-8| they |9-11| will not be |12-15| when |16-16| Westerners |17-18| will be |19-20| more |21-21| discreet |22-22| . |23-23| 
 the departure |0-1| of |2-2| French troops |3-4| in the |5-6| Nijrab |9-9| base |7-8| , |10-10| that |11-11| I have |12-13| seen |14-14| from the hills |15-18| planted |19-19| almond trees |20-21| through |22-24| French |26-26| credits |25-25| , |27-27| was |28-30| in |31-31| order . |32-34| 
 the convoys |0-1| of trucks |2-3| and |4-5| armoured vehicles |6-6| joined |7-8| Kabul |9-9| without being |10-11| attacked , |12-13| flown |14-14| by |15-15| helicopters |16-17| . |18-18| 
 there will be |0-3| no |4-5| flood |6-6| of the Taliban |7-8| in |9-9| Kabul |10-10| by the end |11-13| of |14-14| 2014 |15-15| . |16-16| 
 the circumstances |0-1| have changed |2-3| since their |4-5| irresistible |7-7| advance |6-6| from 1994 |8-9| to 1996 |10-11| . |12-12| 
 Kabul |0-0| was |1-2| empty , |3-4| the country |5-6| ablaze |7-11| because |12-13| of the struggles |14-15| between |16-16| different factions |17-18| . |19-19| 
 their |0-0| takeover |1-3| of the country |4-5| had |6-7| been |8-8| seen as |9-10| a kind |11-12| of liberation |13-14| , |15-15| a return |16-17| to safety |18-20| . |21-21| 
 Afghan women |0-1| have |2-2| paid the price |3-5| of |6-6| obscurantism |7-8| of these |9-10| peasants |11-11| overwhelmed by |12-13| the organization |14-15| of Al |16-17| @-@ |18-18| Qaeda |19-19| , |20-20| but |21-21| their situation |22-23| has not improved |24-28| today |29-31| . |32-32| 
 former |0-0| mujahedin |1-1| , |2-2| Afghan government |3-4| and |5-5| Taliban |7-7| are |8-9| present |6-6| in |10-10| the desire |11-12| to keep |13-14| women |15-16| in a |17-18| subordinate position |19-20| . |21-21| 
 the main |0-1| leaders |2-2| of the |3-4| anti @-@ Soviet |6-6| war |5-5| returned |7-8| to power |9-10| in 2001 |11-12| . |13-13| 
 they |0-0| became |1-4| wheeler @-@ dealers |5-5| , |6-6| seizing |7-8| government |11-11| land |9-10| for resale |12-14| in |15-15| building land |16-18| to refugees |19-20| returned from Iran |21-23| and Pakistan |24-26| , |27-27| with |28-28| huge |29-31| American |33-33| outsourcing |34-37| contracts |32-32| . |38-38| 
 they |0-1| are |2-2| stigmatized |3-3| ; |4-4| most |5-6| of them |7-9| have not |10-14| fought |15-15| themselves |16-18| . |19-19| 
 people |0-1| , |2-2| as I have |3-6| heard |7-7| in the countryside |8-10| , |11-11| aspire to |12-13| a government that |14-16| is not |17-19| made up of |20-21| thieves |22-22| . |23-23| 
 many young people |0-2| want to |3-3| leave , |4-5| as |6-6| will |7-7| those who |8-9| have been able to |10-11| take advantage of |12-13| American largesse |14-15| : |16-16| capital flight |17-20| is considerable . |21-23| 
 young people |0-1| are tired |2-3| of |4-4| the war |5-6| and its |7-9| ideologies . |10-11| 
 they |0-1| worked with |2-2| the |3-3| modern world |4-5| during |6-7| their |8-8| exile |9-9| in Iran |10-11| or |12-12| Pakistan |13-14| , they |15-16| have |17-18| enjoyed |19-19| the benefits |20-21| . |22-22| 
 about 65 |0-1| % |2-2| of |3-3| the population is under |4-8| 25 |9-9| years old |10-10| ; |11-11| Kabul |12-12| now has |13-14| 5 |15-15| million people |16-18| , |19-19| a |20-20| fifth |21-21| of the |22-23| total population |24-25| . |26-26| 
 in |0-0| the cities |1-2| , |3-3| public |6-6| schools |4-5| are full |7-8| , |9-10| girls and |11-12| boys |13-14| . |15-15| 
 it will |0-1| provide work for |2-5| these |6-6| young people who |7-8| won &apos;t want to |9-11| go back to |12-13| the |14-14| dark ages |15-15| of the |16-16| old parties |17-18| or |19-20| corruption |21-22| of |23-23| some leaders |24-25| . |26-26| 
 everyone , |0-1| including |2-3| the |4-4| armed |6-6| opponents |5-5| , |7-7| are |8-8| fond of |9-10| mobile telephones |11-12| ; |13-13| television , |14-16| and his |17-18| Turkish |20-20| soap operas |19-19| that have |21-22| a |23-23| modern world |24-25| , |26-26| is |27-27| followed |28-28| everywhere . |29-30| 
 the army |0-1| is now |2-3| present |4-4| . |5-5| 
 the authorities |0-1| who will |2-3| the |4-4| order |5-5| will be |6-8| considered |9-10| legitimate ? |11-12| 
 the |0-0| former commanders |1-2| of the |3-4| anti @-@ Soviet |6-6| struggle |5-5| are |7-8| already |9-9| rebuilding |10-11| provincial |14-14| militias |12-13| , which |15-16| will escape the |17-18| central power |19-20| . |21-21| 
 Afghanistan |0-1| , a country |2-3| of |4-4| mountains |5-5| , |6-6| with strong |7-8| local |10-10| identities |9-9| , |11-11| should be able to |12-13| enjoy a degree of |14-17| decentralization |18-18| , |19-20| the image |21-22| of the |23-23| Western nations |24-25| , |26-26| but |27-27| the United States has |28-32| sought to |33-33| transform it into |34-36| a |37-37| centralised state |38-39| , |40-41| strong presidential |43-44| power |42-42| , |45-45| abolishing |46-46| the |47-47| post of |48-49| prime minister |50-51| , which |52-52| has existed since |53-54| the 1964 Constitution |55-58| . |59-59| 
 President |0-1| Karzai |2-2| does not want |3-6| foreign |8-8| controls |7-7| , |9-9| particularly |10-11| on the occasion |12-14| of the |15-15| planned elections |16-17| in April |18-19| 2014 |20-20| . |21-21| 
 but |0-0| his country |1-2| is |3-3| , |4-4| since |5-5| the 1950s |6-8| and |9-9| already |10-10| well before |11-12| , |13-13| dependent on |14-15| foreign aid |16-18| . |19-19| 
 no industry has |0-3| been |4-4| restarted |5-7| , no |8-9| dam |10-10| is |11-12| , |13-15| no |16-16| major |18-18| irrigation |19-20| system |17-17| is |21-22| repaired |23-23| . |24-24| 
 everything is |0-1| imported |2-2| ; |3-3| nothing |4-5| is produced |6-7| , except |8-9| fruits |10-10| and vegetables |11-12| . |13-13| 
 the priority |0-1| is |2-2| left to |3-4| private initiative |5-7| . |8-8| 
 in |0-0| a country |1-2| ruined |3-3| by |4-4| 30 years |5-6| of war |7-8| , |9-9| a |10-10| government control |11-12| on infrastructure |13-15| would have been |16-17| necessary . |18-19| 
 the noise |0-1| was |2-3| widespread |4-4| that Afghanistan |5-7| had |8-8| immense |9-10| mineral wealth |11-12| . |13-13| 
 this |0-0| has only added |1-5| to the sense |6-7| that |8-8| Westerners |9-10| were |11-13| only there to |14-16| seize it . |17-20| 
 without energy |0-1| to treat |2-3| iron ore |4-7| and |8-8| copper |9-10| , |11-13| or means |14-16| of transport |17-18| for |19-19| export |20-21| through the mountains |22-25| , |26-26| there is |27-30| no |31-32| mining |33-34| . |35-35| 
 the Chinese |0-1| have already |2-3| almost |4-4| left the |5-6| Mes |11-11| Aynak |12-12| Copper Mine |7-10| , leaving |13-14| international |17-17| archaeologists |15-16| ( |18-18| funded by |19-20| the World Bank |21-23| ) |24-24| search |25-25| the vast |26-27| Buddhist |29-29| site |28-28| and |30-30| remain |31-31| the |32-32| largest employers in |33-36| the province |37-38| . |39-39| 
 it |0-0| also |5-5| will have |1-2| a |3-3| day |4-4| that Afghanistan |6-8| and |9-9| Pakistan |10-11| , |12-12| which |13-13| are heavily dependent on |14-15| imports and |16-17| exports , |18-19| restore |20-20| normal |23-23| relations |21-22| . |24-24| 
 the departure of the |0-2| French troops |3-5| was completed |6-8| on 20 |9-10| November |11-11| . |12-12| 
 the new |0-1| cooperation treaty |2-4| provides for |5-5| the continuation |6-7| of |8-8| traditional |10-10| aid |9-9| : |11-11| high school |12-12| girls |13-14| , |15-16| boys |17-17| , |18-18| French |21-21| department |19-20| at |22-22| the university |23-24| , |25-25| French Institute |26-27| , |28-28| cooperation in |29-30| the |31-31| military |32-33| , legal |34-35| , medical |36-37| and agricultural |38-39| , |40-40| support for |41-42| the |43-43| Archaeological |45-45| Delegation |44-44| . |46-46| 
 since |0-0| 2009 |1-1| , |2-2| in an attempt to |3-5| &quot; |6-6| win |7-7| the hearts and minds |8-12| &quot; and |13-14| to achieve |15-16| the |17-17| impossible task |18-19| of |20-20| matching |21-22| aid |23-23| and |24-24| offensive |26-26| actions |25-25| , |27-27| &quot; |30-32| a |28-29| civil @-@ military |34-36| actions |33-33| &quot; |37-37| by the Ministry of Defence |38-42| ( |43-43| CIMIC ) |44-45| , |46-46| deleted |47-47| in 2012 |48-49| , |50-50| led |51-52| , |53-53| and |54-55| carried out |56-58| by |59-59| a small |60-61| French NGO |62-63| , |64-64| many |65-66| public works |67-70| and |71-71| agricultural |75-75| rehabilitation activities |72-74| in dozens |76-78| of |79-79| mountain villages |80-82| . |83-83| 
 this work |0-1| , |2-2| requiring |3-4| local |10-10| workforce |5-9| , |11-11| were able to |12-13| help |14-15| contain |16-16| the insurgency |17-18| : irrigation |19-20| , |21-21| wells , |22-23| drinking water |24-25| , |26-26| reforestation |27-27| , |28-28| fruit trees |29-30| , |31-31| soil |33-34| protection |32-32| and |35-35| increase crop acreage |36-39| . |40-40| 
 that |0-0| will leave |1-1| us |2-3| as a souvenir |4-5| , |6-6| after two |7-8| billion euros |9-11| of |12-12| military spending |13-14| ? |15-15| 
 a |0-0| far more modest |2-4| budget |1-1| would contribute to |5-6| improving |7-9| local living conditions |10-13| , |14-14| very hard |15-16| in these |17-18| valleys |19-20| often at |21-22| more than |23-24| 2,000 |25-26| metres |27-27| above sea level |28-29| . |30-30| 
 the embassy |0-1| has received |2-3| dozens |4-5| of written requests for |6-9| small |10-10| agricultural |12-12| achievements |11-11| from |13-14| local communities |15-16| in the province |17-19| of |20-20| Kapisa |21-21| . |22-22| 
 so they |0-2| are released |3-4| from |5-5| the insurgency |6-7| waged |8-8| by |9-10| foreign groups |11-12| , |13-13| such |14-14| as |15-15| farmers |16-17| have told me |18-20| to wish |21-21| , it |22-23| should remain |24-25| in |26-26| their |27-27| favour |28-28| a small |29-30| civilian assistance |31-32| , |33-33| well @-@ controlled |34-35| and |36-36| that |37-37| directly affects them |38-40| . |41-41| 
 a Constitution |0-1| the |2-2| forceps |3-3| in Egypt |4-5| 
 it is |0-1| a new |2-3| gamble |4-6| of President |7-8| Mohammed |9-9| Morsi |10-10| . |11-11| 
 while |0-1| Egypt |2-3| is |4-4| more divided |5-6| than ever |7-8| around |9-10| the |11-11| constitutional declaration |12-13| , which |14-15| grants him |16-17| temporarily |18-18| full powers |19-21| , |22-22| he |23-23| decided |24-25| to play |26-27| everything |28-31| . |32-32| 
 taking |0-0| everyone |1-3| by surprise |4-5| , |6-6| he announced |7-9| Wednesday |10-12| that |13-13| the Constituent Assembly |14-16| would vote |17-17| its |18-18| final text |19-20| the next day |21-22| . |23-23| 
 just |0-4| a week ago , |5-7| the head of state |8-12| had granted |13-14| two |15-15| months |16-17| in |18-18| this House |19-20| to finish |21-22| its work |23-24| . |25-25| 
 nearly two years ago |0-3| that |4-4| Egypt |5-6| builds on |7-9| a |10-10| draft text |11-12| , |13-13| amended |16-16| several times |14-15| which weakens |17-19| the |20-20| institutional stability |21-22| and |23-23| led to |24-26| legal |28-28| imbroglios |27-27| . |29-29| 
 this |0-0| new initiative |1-2| has only increased |3-7| the divide |8-9| in |10-10| the country |11-12| . |13-13| 
 for |0-0| his opponents |1-2| , |3-3| President |4-5| perseveres |6-6| in his |7-8| &quot; |9-9| autocratic |11-11| delirium |10-10| , &quot; |12-13| continuing to |14-15| &quot; |16-16| betraying |17-17| its word |18-19| &quot; |20-20| and |21-22| &quot; |23-23| trampling |24-24| the law |25-26| . &quot; |27-28| 
 on the side |0-1| of |2-2| his supporters |3-4| , it |5-6| ensures |7-7| that |8-8| it is |9-10| a means |11-12| to end |13-15| as soon as possible |16-18| with |19-19| the institutional and political crisis |20-24| , |25-25| accelerating |26-27| the transition process |28-31| . |32-32| 
 a referendum |0-1| should |2-2| be |3-3| held |4-4| within 15 |5-7| days |8-8| . |9-9| 
 a |0-0| very short period of time |1-5| which obliges |6-7| the Brothers |8-9| to |10-10| abandon |11-12| their project |13-14| to explain |15-16| the text |17-18| , |19-19| article by article |20-22| , |23-24| Egyptians |25-25| . |26-26| 
 for |0-0| the President |1-2| , |3-3| it is also a |4-7| way to |8-9| regain |10-10| popular |13-13| and democratic |14-15| legitimacy |11-12| , while |16-17| the |18-18| dispute |19-19| raged |20-21| across |22-23| the country |24-25| . |26-26| 
 Mohammed |0-0| Morsi |1-1| seems |2-2| convinced that |3-4| the Egyptians |5-6| will vote |7-7| favourably |8-8| , |9-9| as he |10-12| said |13-14| in an interview with |15-18| the |19-19| US |21-21| weekly |20-20| Time |22-22| . |23-23| 
 as |0-2| the |3-3| use of |4-5| a |6-6| hasty |8-8| vote |7-7| takes |9-9| the |10-11| ultimatum |12-12| to the |13-13| Egyptian people |14-15| : |16-16| &quot; |17-17| either |18-18| you vote |19-20| for my |21-22| text |23-23| , |24-25| I keep |26-27| the |28-28| full powers |29-30| , &quot; |31-32| they |33-35| would |36-36| supposedly |37-37| end |38-39| after |40-40| the adoption |41-42| of |43-43| the Constitution |44-45| . |46-46| 
 it is in |0-2| a |3-3| strange |5-5| atmosphere |4-4| that 85 |6-7| members of |8-9| the |10-10| Constituent |12-12| Assembly |11-11| , |13-14| Islamist |17-17| majority |15-16| , |18-18| voted |19-20| the text |21-22| yesterday . |23-24| 
 most of the |0-2| Liberals |3-3| were missing . |4-8| 
 in mid |0-0| @-@ |1-1| November |2-2| , |3-3| shortly before |4-5| the |6-6| constitutional declaration |7-8| , |9-9| they had |10-11| slammed |12-12| the door |13-14| , |15-15| feeling they have not |16-19| been able to express their |20-23| views |24-24| . |25-25| 
 representatives |0-1| of human rights |2-6| , |7-7| religious minorities |8-10| or |11-12| civil |15-16| society |13-14| had done |17-18| the same . |19-21| 
 in order |0-0| that the |1-2| necessary quorum |3-4| is reached |5-6| , |7-7| 11 people |8-9| , |10-11| substitute members |12-13| , |14-14| were added |15-17| in haste |18-20| , |21-21| yesterday |22-22| morning |23-23| . |24-24| 
 some |0-0| are very |1-2| close to the |3-4| Muslim Brotherhood |5-6| . |7-7| 
 not surprisingly |0-1| , |2-2| it is |3-4| most often |5-7| unanimously |8-10| that |11-11| the articles |12-13| were voted |14-16| . |17-17| 
 commentators |0-2| are |3-5| amused |6-6| by the |7-7| fact that |8-9| one of the |10-11| only differences |12-13| of |14-14| the day |15-16| has spoken |17-19| around |20-21| ... |22-22| the hour |23-24| of |25-25| prayer |26-27| , some |28-29| members of the committee |30-32| felt that |33-34| the pendulum |35-36| of |37-37| the Constituent Assembly |38-39| was poorly |40-41| paid |42-42| . |43-43| 
 the text |0-1| , which |2-3| was still |4-5| being |6-10| voted |11-11| yesterday |12-12| evening |13-13| , |14-14| includes |15-15| 234 |16-16| articles . |17-18| 
 objects |0-0| of attention |1-4| , |5-5| Article |6-7| 2 |8-8| remains |9-9| finally |10-10| identical to |11-12| that of |13-14| the 1971 constitution |15-18| , |19-19| stating that |20-21| &quot; |22-22| the principles |23-24| of sharia |25-27| are |28-28| the |29-29| main source |30-31| of law |32-33| . &quot; |34-35| 
 the |0-0| Salafi parties |1-2| , |3-3| for whom |4-5| the establishment |6-8| of |9-9| Islamic law |10-11| is a |12-13| major |15-15| claim |14-14| , |16-16| hoped to |17-18| replace &quot; |19-20| principles |21-22| &quot; |23-23| by |24-24| &quot; |25-25| the rules |26-27| , &quot; |28-29| which |30-31| would have allowed |32-33| a stricter application |34-37| . |38-38| 
 for |0-0| the Islamists |1-2| , |3-3| the fact |4-5| that |6-6| this article |7-8| has not |9-11| been |12-12| amended |13-13| is a |14-15| sign of goodwill |16-20| and |21-23| respect for the |24-25| other components |26-27| of |28-28| Egyptian society |29-31| . |32-32| 
 &quot; |0-0| hypocrisy |1-1| , &quot; |2-3| replied |4-4| the liberals |5-6| , |7-7| who see it as just |8-12| a |13-15| communication . |16-17| 
 because |0-0| according to them |1-2| , |3-3| the Islamization |4-5| of |6-6| the Constitution |7-8| is done |9-10| through |11-12| other |13-14| articles . |15-16| 
 they |0-0| include |1-2| Article |3-4| 220 |5-5| , which |6-7| gives |8-9| Al @-@ |12-13| Azhar |14-14| University , |10-11| an advisory role |15-17| , |18-18| particularly |19-20| with regard |21-24| to check |25-26| the conformity |27-28| of laws |29-30| with |31-31| sharia law |32-33| . |34-34| 
 according to |0-0| the |1-1| specialist in |2-3| Egypt |4-5| Sophie |6-6| Pommier |7-7| , |8-8| it |9-9| is worrying |10-11| because |12-12| &quot; people |13-15| called to |16-17| decide |18-19| are not elected |20-23| and |24-24| have no |25-27| democratic legitimacy |28-29| . |30-30| 
 you can |0-2| see |3-3| the beginnings |4-5| of a |6-7| theocracy |8-8| . &quot; |9-10| 
 the fears |0-1| of the |2-2| Liberals |3-3| are |4-4| also |5-6| fueled by |7-8| the fact |9-10| that the next |11-13| president of |14-15| this |16-16| university should |17-18| be |19-19| much less |20-21| moderate than |22-23| the current |24-25| . |26-26| 
 &quot; for |0-1| the moment , |2-4| there is |5-8| no |9-10| concrete |13-13| religious |12-12| involvement |11-11| . |14-14| 
 with |0-0| this |1-1| Constitution |2-2| , it |3-4| remains |5-5| within the framework |6-8| of |9-9| the state |10-11| . |12-13| 
 most of the |0-2| lawyers |3-3| who worked |4-6| on |7-7| this text |8-9| are not |10-12| intellectuals |13-14| and |15-15| academics |16-17| , |18-18| some |19-20| trained |21-21| in the |22-23| French system |24-25| &quot; |26-26| moderates |27-27| Alexis |28-28| Blouet |29-29| , |30-30| who |31-31| is preparing |32-32| a thesis |33-34| on the |35-36| Egyptian |39-39| constitutional transition |37-38| . |40-40| 
 but |0-0| he acknowledges |1-2| that &quot; |3-4| there may be |5-8| some ambiguity |9-10| around |11-12| Article |13-14| 220 |15-15| , because |16-17| the |18-18| terms |19-20| used |21-21| in |22-22| religious |24-24| vocabulary |23-23| . |25-25| 
 it |0-1| refers |2-3| to the |4-4| &quot; |5-5| fiqh |6-6| &quot; |7-7| including |8-8| &#91; |9-9| Islamic |11-11| jurisprudence |10-10| , |12-12| ndlr |13-13| &#93; |14-14| . |15-15| 
 and |0-0| the issue |1-2| could |3-3| arise |7-8| in the future |4-6| to know |9-10| the extent |11-13| of |14-14| civilian judges |15-16| are competent to |17-19| decide |20-21| . &quot; |22-24| 
 beyond |0-3| its |4-4| religious aspect |5-6| , |7-7| the text |8-9| voted |10-10| yesterday |11-11| is highly |12-13| criticized |14-14| because |15-16| of the |17-17| powers |18-19| it |20-21| grants the |22-23| President of |24-25| the Republic |26-27| . |28-28| 
 the Muslim Brotherhood |0-2| argue |3-4| that they |5-8| are significantly |9-10| reduced in |11-12| comparison |13-13| to |14-14| what they |15-17| were under |18-19| the |20-20| old regime |21-22| . |23-23| 
 another |0-0| point of contention |1-2| : |3-3| the powers |4-5| conferred |6-6| to |7-7| the army |8-9| . |10-10| 
 in accordance with the wishes |0-2| of the military |3-4| , |5-5| the review |6-7| of the |8-8| defence budget |9-12| will not be |13-15| submitted |16-16| to Parliament |17-18| , |19-19| but at a |20-22| National Defence Council |23-26| . |27-27| 
 nor |0-3| will be banned |4-5| the |6-6| trial of |7-8| civilians in |9-10| military courts |11-13| , as |14-16| requested by the |17-18| associations for the defence of |19-22| human |24-26| rights |23-23| . |27-27| 
 they |0-1| are also |2-3| part |4-4| of |5-5| their concerns |6-7| about the text |8-11| , |12-12| they deem |13-15| liberticidal |16-16| . |17-17| 
 the crime |0-1| of blasphemy |2-3| is |4-4| maintained and |5-6| insult |7-8| is now |9-10| prohibited , |11-12| which could |13-15| have serious |16-18| consequences for |19-20| freedom |21-22| of expression |23-24| , freedom of the press |25-28| in particular |29-29| . |30-30|

 the |0-0| Human Rights |2-6| Defenders |1-1| noted |7-7| , however , |8-8| an important aspect |9-11| of |12-12| the law on |13-16| the language |17-18| . |19-19| 
 the reviews |0-1| will be |2-2| intended solely |3-4| to migrants |5-6| who have |7-8| a |9-9| legal status |10-11| . |12-12| 
 without status |0-1| , |2-2| there |3-5| will be no |6-8| review |9-9| or |10-11| official |13-13| work |12-12| thereafter |14-16| . |17-17| 
 yet , |0-1| most |2-3| migrant workers |4-6| continue |7-7| to live |8-9| in Russia |10-11| illegally |12-14| . |15-15| 
 &quot; |0-0| welcome |1-1| or |2-2| defence |3-3| to enter |4-5| &quot; |6-6| 
 many immigrants |0-2| explained |3-3| that it |4-5| is not |6-8| so easy |9-10| to obtain |11-12| an |13-13| official status |14-15| in Russia |16-17| . |18-18| 
 the reason |0-1| ? |2-2| administrative barriers |3-5| and |6-6| always |7-7| these |8-8| language difficulties |9-10| . |11-11| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| the legalization |3-4| costs money |5-8| : |9-9| between |10-10| 12 and |11-12| 16 |13-13| miles |14-14| rubles |15-15| . |16-16| 
 and |0-0| then |1-1| , |2-2| you can |3-4| get |5-5| a false |6-7| registration |8-8| quickly |9-9| for |10-10| only |11-11| 1,500 |12-13| rubles |14-14| . |15-15| 
 Russian |2-2| police officers |0-1| know that |3-4| we have |5-6| forged |7-8| documents , |9-10| that |11-11| we do not have |12-15| to register |16-17| , |18-19| where |20-20| cases |21-22| of extortion |23-24| . |25-25| 
 &quot; they |0-1| ask us |2-3| 100 |4-4| , |5-5| 200 |6-6| rubles |7-7| , |8-9| what to |10-11| buy cigarettes |12-14| , |15-15| tea |16-17| , &quot; said |18-21| to reporters |22-23| Umed |24-24| Khouchkadamov |25-25| , a national |26-27| of Tajikistan |28-29| . |30-30|

 on the first |0-2| day of |3-4| the entry |5-6| into force |7-8| of the law on |9-13| the language |14-15| , |16-16| it was discovered |17-19| that the |20-21| registration |23-24| papers |22-22| of migrants |25-26| were not |27-29| the only ones to |30-32| be |33-33| false |34-34| . |35-35| 
 several |0-0| false |1-1| certificates of |2-3| language |6-6| examinations |4-5| have already |7-8| been confiscated |9-10| by |11-11| employees |12-13| of the |14-14| Federal Migration Service |15-18| . |19-19| 
 the |0-0| falsified |2-2| papers |1-1| out |3-3| of a |4-5| regular |8-8| colour printer |6-7| . |9-9| 
 of course |0-1| , |2-2| their |3-3| new owners |4-5| have not |6-9| had |10-10| for nothing |11-12| : |13-13| each migrant |14-15| who |16-16| hoped |17-17| to |18-19| facilitate |20-20| the task |21-22| of examinations |23-24| had to pay |25-27| seven |28-28| thousand rubles |29-30| for |31-31| this document |32-33| . |34-34| 
 it is |0-1| two |2-2| and a half times more |3-6| expensive than |7-8| the official procedure |9-11| : |12-12| it |13-15| will cost the |16-17| migrant worker |18-19| three thousand |20-21| rubles |22-22| . |23-23| 
 the representatives |0-1| of power |2-3| and |4-5| human rights |7-11| advocates |6-6| agree that |12-16| the short @-@ term goal |17-21| is to protect |22-24| the system |25-26| against |27-27| corruption |28-29| to make it |30-33| impossible to |34-35| simply |36-36| buy |37-37| these &quot; |38-39| pieces of paper |40-42| . &quot; |43-44| 
 the authorities |0-1| can give |2-3| to migrant workers |4-6| who have not |7-10| been able to |11-11| validate |12-12| the review |13-14| of the |15-15| first |16-17| time |18-19| to |20-20| attend language courses |21-25| . |26-26| 
 moreover |0-1| , immigrants |2-4| who do not know |5-8| the |9-9| Russian |10-10| will be |11-12| offered |13-13| a job |14-15| in areas that |16-19| do not involve |20-23| actively communicate |24-25| with |26-26| people |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the Ministry |0-1| of |2-2| the Interior |3-4| does not |5-8| the |9-9| arms |11-12| market |10-10| 
 the share |0-1| of crimes |2-3| involving |4-5| legal weapons |6-7| is |8-8| very low |9-10| 
 the |0-0| Russian Ministry |1-2| of |3-3| the Interior |4-5| proposes to |6-7| toughen |8-8| the law |9-10| against the |11-14| civilian |18-18| weapons |15-17| . |19-19| 
 such is |0-1| the reaction |2-3| of the authorities |4-5| in the face of |6-8| recent incidents |9-10| : |11-11| whether |12-15| fire |16-18| at weddings |19-21| or |22-23| the massacre |24-25| organized by |26-27| the |28-28| Moscow |30-30| lawyer |29-29| Dmitry |31-31| Vinogradov |32-32| , who made |33-36| seven |37-37| deaths . |38-39| 
 the police |0-1| wants to |2-2| ban |3-3| the wearing |4-5| of weapons |6-7| to |8-8| rubber bullets |9-11| in public places |12-15| and |16-16| raise the |17-18| legal age |19-20| for obtaining |21-23| weapons permit |24-28| from |29-33| 18 to |34-35| 21 |36-36| years |37-37| . |38-38| 
 the idea |0-1| was |2-3| supported by |4-5| the head |6-7| of the Duma Committee |8-12| for |13-13| security |14-15| and |16-16| the fight |17-18| against |19-19| corruption |20-21| , |22-22| Irina |23-23| Yarovaya |24-24| who promised |25-27| that the |28-29| amendments to |30-31| the Weapons Act |32-36| would be introduced |37-38| in |39-39| the State Duma |40-43| soon . |44-45| 
 everybody |0-2| is not |3-5| pleased to see |6-8| that the |9-10| Russian authorities |11-12| are trying to |13-14| solve the |15-16| problem by |17-18| &quot; |19-19| tightening |20-20| the screw |21-22| . &quot; |23-24| 
 an open letter |0-2| appeared |3-4| on |5-5| the Internet |6-7| in which |8-9| its |10-10| authors |11-11| , representatives from |12-15| various centres |16-17| of fire |18-19| , require |20-21| to abandon |22-23| &quot; |24-24| the |25-25| foolish |27-27| hardening |26-26| . &quot; |28-29| 
 the percentage |0-1| of |2-2| crimes committed |3-4| with |5-5| a gun |6-7| registered |8-8| is minimal |9-10| , |11-11| told the |12-14| Russian |16-16| service |15-15| Vasiliy |17-17| Lesnikov |18-18| , |19-19| a lawyer |20-20| and |21-21| crime |23-24| specialist |22-22| for |25-25| the BBC |26-27| . |28-28| 
 according to statistics from the |0-3| Ministry of |4-5| the Interior |6-7| , |8-8| on |9-9| a six @-@ month period |10-14| in 2012 |15-16| , |17-17| 142 |18-18| crimes were committed |19-22| with |23-23| a firearm |24-27| registered in |28-29| the police services |30-33| while |34-35| 1,168 |36-36| thousand |37-37| crimes |38-38| were |39-40| recorded in |41-42| the |43-43| same period |44-45| . |46-46| 
 the authors |0-1| of the |2-3| open letter |4-5| are |6-6| certain |7-7| that |8-8| the strengthening |9-10| of laws |11-12| on |13-14| civilian |16-16| weapons |15-15| will not prevent |17-19| criminals |20-21| from gaining access |22-24| to the |25-25| black market |26-27| . |28-28| 
 according to them |0-1| , |2-2| we can |3-4| find |5-5| today |6-7| in Moscow |8-9| any weapon |10-13| for |14-14| a reasonable price |15-17| . |18-18| 
 however , |0-1| the Ministry |2-3| of |4-4| the Interior |5-6| says he |7-9| controls the |10-11| dissemination of |12-13| illegal weapons |14-15| . |16-16|

 the black market |0-2| of weapons |3-4| is |5-5| provided |6-6| via |7-7| several |8-8| channels . |9-10| 
 the |0-0| main channels |1-2| are five |3-7| , &quot; says |8-9| Viktor |10-10| Baranets |11-11| , a |12-12| retired |14-16| colonel |13-13| who served |17-18| 10 years |19-20| in the |21-21| Ministry |22-22| of Education |23-25| and |26-26| at Headquarters |27-29| . |30-30| 
 screenshot |0-2| from |3-4| a site |5-6| taking |7-7| orders |8-9| of weapons |10-11| 
 the first |0-1| is |2-2| the &quot; |3-4| military |6-6| record |5-5| , &quot; that |7-9| is to say |10-14| the |15-15| weapons that |16-17| were stolen |18-20| during |21-21| the |22-22| military operations |23-24| in |25-25| the Caucasus |26-27| . |28-28| 
 &quot; |0-0| these weapons |1-2| were stolen |3-5| by |6-6| Russian officers |7-9| , |10-10| but also |11-12| by |13-13| Caucasians |14-15| , &quot; |16-17| said |18-18| Baranets |19-19| . |20-20| 
 the |0-0| second type |1-2| of weapons |3-4| from the |5-6| black market |7-8| are those |9-10| stolen |11-11| by |12-12| criminals |13-14| to the police |15-19| . |20-20|

 the |0-0| illegal |2-2| guns |1-1| go on |3-4| sale |5-5| since |6-6| the |7-7| military |9-9| warehouses |8-8| . |10-10| 
 many of |0-1| them |2-3| have often |4-5| suffered |6-6| explosions |7-8| . |9-9| 
 &quot; |0-0| certified |3-3| versions |1-2| indicate that |4-5| some of the |6-6| fires were started |7-10| deliberately |11-12| to hide |13-14| the deficit |15-16| , &quot; |17-18| said |19-19| the former |20-21| military . |22-23| 
 for |0-0| Baranets , |1-2| arms manufacturers |3-6| are there for a reason |7-11| . |12-12| 
 &quot; |0-0| you see |1-3| private |7-7| weapons factories |4-6| that |8-8| do not compete |9-11| with |12-12| competition in |13-15| the international market |16-18| and |19-19| sell |20-20| weapons |21-22| on |23-23| the black market |24-26| , particularly |27-28| in Moscow |29-30| , &quot; |31-32| says |33-33| one expert |34-35| . |36-36|

 the protests |0-1| began |2-3| last week |4-7| after |8-8| Thanksgiving , |9-10| the |11-11| &quot; |12-12| Black Friday |13-14| , &quot; |15-16| when |17-19| a |20-20| freak |22-22| rain |21-21| of |23-23| seizing |25-27| balances |24-24| million inhabitants |28-30| has befallen |31-34| America and |35-37| sometimes |39-40| trigger |38-38| clashes |41-41| . |42-42| 
 on that day |0-3| , some |4-5| Walmart |10-10| employees of the company |6-9| , |11-11| which employs |12-13| around the world |14-16| 2.2 |17-17| million people |18-20| , |21-21| have left |22-23| their posts |24-25| to |26-26| organize |27-28| picket lines |29-31| with unions |32-34| and |35-35| left @-@ wing |38-39| activists |36-37| in stores |40-42| of |43-43| the company |44-45| whose products |46-48| are |49-49| intended for consumers |50-52| of |53-53| modest |55-55| and middle |56-57| classes |54-54| . |58-58| 
 Walmart |0-0| sells |1-1| everything from |2-4| diapers |5-5| to |6-6| hunting |8-9| rifles |7-7| through |10-12| the |13-13| car batteries |14-16| , |17-17| vacuum cleaners |18-19| , eggs |20-22| and |23-23| milk |24-25| . |26-26|

 that is why |0-2| many |3-4| low @-@ paid |6-7| workers |5-5| at Walmart |8-9| shop |10-12| only |13-13| at their place of work |14-18| . |19-19| 
 the price |0-1| and |2-2| the choice |3-4| of |5-5| Walmart &apos;s |9-10| products |6-6| have been |7-8| one of |11-13| the most powerful |15-17| groups |14-14| in the United States |18-21| . |22-22| 
 according to |0-0| critics |1-2| , |3-3| Walmart |4-4| can afford to |5-8| sell its |9-10| cheap |12-13| products |11-11| including |14-14| because of low wages |15-19| of |20-20| its employees |21-22| . |23-23| 
 they |0-1| also |4-4| complain |2-3| of |5-5| difficult working conditions |6-9| , |10-10| for example |11-12| the lack |13-14| of |15-15| forklifts |16-17| or |18-19| portable |21-21| scanners |20-20| . |22-22| 
 the participants |0-1| of the |2-2| &quot; Black Friday &quot; |4-8| protests |3-3| calling for |9-9| an increase |10-11| in wages |12-13| , they |14-15| have complained |16-20| that |21-21| the price |22-23| of |24-24| medical insurance |25-27| provided by |28-29| the company |30-31| had increased |32-33| from |34-34| 30 |35-35| to 100 |36-37| dollars |38-38| per month |39-40| . |41-41|

 scientists from |0-2| the University |3-4| of California |5-5| at |6-6| Berkley |7-7| show that |8-9| if |10-10| Walmart |11-11| increased |12-12| the average wage |13-15| to $ 12 |16-18| an hour |19-21| , |22-22| it would cost |23-24| the group |25-26| $ 3.2 billion |27-30| . |31-31| 
 it is |0-1| 1.1 |2-2| % |3-4| more than |5-6| what it |7-9| currently spends |10-11| . |12-12| 
 if |0-0| Walmart |1-1| transferred |2-2| any |3-3| wage increases |4-7| on |8-8| the shoulders |9-10| of consumers |11-12| , |13-13| every race |14-15| in |16-16| the store |17-18| their |19-19| would be tantamount |20-20| to 46 |21-22| cents more |23-25| . |26-26| 
 they |0-0| will spend |1-1| in a |2-3| year only |4-5| 12.39 |6-6| dollars more |7-9| than now |10-11| . |12-12|

 the |0-0| highlight of |1-3| the protest |4-5| was |6-7| the |8-8| midday |10-13| rally |9-9| near the |14-15| McDonald &apos;s |16-17| in |18-18| Times Square |19-20| with |21-21| the intervention |22-23| of several |24-25| local |28-28| Democratic policies |26-27| , including |29-30| that of |31-32| Jumaane |33-33| Williams |34-34| , a member |35-36| of the |37-37| City Council |38-39| , |40-40| who |41-41| said |42-43| : |44-44| &quot; |45-45| McDonald &apos;s |46-47| announcement |48-48| sell |49-49| billions |50-51| of |52-52| portions and |53-54| after |55-55| they did |56-57| not even |60-61| give you |58-59| sick leave |62-64| and do |65-67| not pay |68-69| the |70-70| work you have done |71-75| honestly |76-76| ! |77-77| . &quot; |78-79| 
 the protesters |0-1| were |2-3| supported by |4-5| other |6-7| New York |9-11| Democrats |8-8| , |12-14| including |15-15| by the |16-17| candidate for the post of |18-21| mayor |22-22| Bill |23-23| De |24-24| Blasio |25-25| , who |26-26| said |27-28| that |29-29| &quot; we |30-31| all need to |32-33| support the |34-35| fast @-@ food |37-40| workers |36-36| so they get |41-44| a |45-45| fair |47-47| wage |46-46| and |48-48| economic well @-@ being |49-53| that |54-54| deserves |55-55| every |56-56| New |57-57| Yorkers |58-59| . |60-60| 
 the |0-0| New York |1-2| Times |3-3| characterized |4-5| the event |6-7| as |8-8| the |9-9| largest |10-11| ever of the |12-15| fast @-@ food |17-20| sector |16-16| throughout |21-22| its history |23-24| . |25-25| 
 but only |0-1| a few |2-2| hundred people |3-5| attended |6-8| and |9-10| that not all were |11-15| employees |16-17| of |18-18| fast @-@ food |19-21| , |22-22| which |23-23| employ tens |24-26| of thousands |27-28| of people |29-30| in New |31-32| York |33-33| . |34-34| 
 for the moment |2-4| , it is |0-1| difficult to |5-6| say whether |7-8| this |9-9| spark of |10-11| mass movement |12-14| will be |15-15| small |16-17| . |18-18| 
 &quot; for |0-1| the moment |2-3| , it |4-5| happens only |6-8| moderately |9-9| to |10-10| fool |11-11| the brain |12-13| &quot; |14-14| 
 recently , |0-1| the fans |2-3| of the |4-4| new technologies |5-6| have grown accustomed to |7-10| collect the |11-12| augmented reality |13-14| through |15-17| special glasses |18-19| . |20-20| 
 initially , |0-2| it is |3-4| Google |5-5| , which |6-6| unveiled |7-8| this summer |9-10| its |11-11| current model |12-13| at its |14-16| annual conference |17-18| and |19-19| in November , |20-21| it was |22-23| learned that |24-25| Microsoft |26-26| had made |27-28| the request |29-30| of the patent |31-32| . |33-33| 
 however , |0-1| it appears from |2-4| the |5-5| interview with |6-7| the |8-8| group &apos;s |10-11| director |9-9| of |12-12| interactive |16-16| 3D |15-15| technologies |13-14| Microsoft |19-19| &apos;s lab |17-18| in Cambridge |20-21| , |22-22| Shahram |23-23| Izadi |24-24| , |25-25| only for |26-27| the company |31-32| &apos;s |30-30| scientists |28-29| , |33-33| the glasses |34-35| are already |36-37| ancient history |38-41| . |42-42| 
 they are |0-1| tempted |2-2| by |3-3| the prospect |4-5| of |6-6| manipulate |7-8| virtual |10-10| objects |9-9| in |11-11| the air |12-13| with bare hands |14-16| , |17-17| through the creation of |18-21| virtual spaces |22-23| open |24-24| . |25-25| 
 - |0-0| Could you |1-3| tell us |4-5| in |6-6| a few words |7-8| what |9-11| your |12-12| research group |13-15| ? |16-16| 
 - |0-0| We |1-1| are working |2-2| on |3-3| the interaction |4-5| between |6-6| man and machine |7-11| , and |12-12| at the same |15-17| time |18-18| we are trying |13-14| to expand |19-20| the boundaries |21-22| of |23-23| this interaction |24-25| . |26-26| 
 humanity |0-1| as a whole |2-5| remained |6-7| at the moment |8-10| the |11-11| pixels |12-12| on |13-13| flat @-@ |15-15| screen |14-14| and |16-16| touch |19-19| at times |17-18| . |20-20| 
 we want to |0-1| look at |2-2| 5 to |3-4| 10 |5-5| years |6-6| ahead of us |7-8| and |9-9| guess |10-10| the |11-11| radical changes |12-13| that |14-14| occur |15-16| with |17-17| this interaction |18-19| . |20-20| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| the |3-3| Xbox console |4-5| and |6-6| the |7-7| Kinect |9-9| sensors |8-8| are a |10-11| step forward |12-14| , |15-15| and |16-16| almost no |17-18| Xbox |19-19| is |20-21| sold |22-22| today |23-24| without |25-25| Kinect |26-26| because |27-27| everyone |28-30| is interested in |31-33| the order by |34-36| the gesture |37-38| . |39-39| 
 - |0-0| What |1-1| we |2-2| also |4-4| reserve |3-3| the future |5-6| ? |7-7| 
 - |0-0| Although |1-2| the |3-3| Kinect |4-4| has rendered |5-6| the |7-7| physical |9-9| interaction |8-8| , |10-10| many things |11-13| are taking place |14-15| on |16-16| flat |18-18| screen |17-17| , sometimes |19-20| in 3D |21-22| . |23-23| 
 the seizure |0-1| of |2-2| the information |3-4| has |5-5| been |6-6| improved ( |7-8| the system |9-10| receives |11-11| more data |12-14| ) |15-15| , |16-16| but |17-17| the performance |18-19| , |20-20| for |21-21| the moment |22-23| , |24-24| not really |25-26| . |27-27| 
 we are trying |0-1| to change |2-3| that and |4-5| we are working |6-7| on |8-9| truly |13-13| 3D |14-14| imaging |11-12| systems |10-10| operating on |15-16| different technologies |17-18| , including |19-20| the |21-21| projection |23-24| technologies |22-22| . |25-25| 
 we need to break |0-3| the |4-4| computer world |5-6| in |7-7| ours |8-9| , |10-10| in the |11-12| physical world |13-14| , |15-15| make it more |16-18| tactile . |19-20| 
 for |0-0| this , |1-2| however |3-3| , we need to identify |4-7| not only |8-9| the user |10-11| , |12-12| but also |13-14| the space around it |15-19| . |20-20| 
 thus , |0-1| we will be able to |2-3| complete the |4-5| real world |6-7| by |8-8| virtual objects |9-11| in a |12-13| more practical |15-16| form |14-14| . |17-17| 
 and |0-0| to begin with |1-2| , |3-3| let us get rid |4-6| of these |7-8| stupid |9-9| virtual reality |11-13| helmets |10-10| ! |14-14| 
 - |0-0| What do you think of |1-5| the |6-6| voice commands |7-8| ? |9-9| 
 it |0-0| is appreciated |1-2| , |3-3| but |4-4| is it not |5-9| overstated |10-10| ? |11-11| 
 you can &apos;t |0-3| say that |4-5| this |6-6| is |7-7| the |8-8| panacea |9-9| : |10-10| the issue |11-12| of confidentiality |13-14| arises |15-16| because |17-18| we don &apos;t |19-22| always want |23-24| to tell others about |25-29| his actions |30-31| or |32-33| intentions |34-35| . |36-36| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| each type |3-4| of interaction |5-6| with |7-7| the computer |8-9| is good |10-11| , |12-12| but |13-13| each |14-14| in its niche |15-17| . |18-18| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| to order |3-4| the devices |5-6| in public places |7-10| , |11-11| we had |12-13| a project |14-15| for which |16-17| we thought |18-19| to |20-20| gestures |21-22| , |23-23| not |24-24| broad |27-27| gestures |25-26| , |28-28| but |29-29| rather to |30-31| discrete |34-34| gestures |32-33| , |35-35| restricted . |36-37| 
 the gestures |0-1| were not |2-4| captured by |5-6| the camera |7-8| of |9-9| the device |10-11| , |12-12| but |13-13| by |14-14| a bracelet |15-16| worn |17-17| by hand |18-20| , which |21-21| recorded |22-22| the movements |23-24| of bones and |25-28| muscles . |29-30| 
 he |0-0| is |1-2| great |3-3| , |4-4| but |5-5| it |6-6| is theoretically |7-8| possible to |9-10| reduce it |11-12| to |13-13| the size |14-15| of |16-16| a watch |17-18| . |19-19| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| the future |3-4| will be |5-5| marked by |6-7| the |8-8| joint |10-10| command |9-9| , |11-11| for example |12-13| : |14-14| gesture |15-15| + |16-16| votes |17-17| . |18-18| 
 - |0-0| It is |1-2| to say |3-4| ? |5-5| 
 - |0-0| For example |1-2| , |3-3| how |4-6| would you ask |8-10| me |7-7| to |11-11| this |13-14| can |15-15| you |12-12| ? |16-16| 
 you would with |0-3| the floor |4-5| and |6-6| with |7-7| gestures |8-9| . |10-10| 
 - |0-0| Typically |1-2| , I |3-4| spoke |5-5| only |6-6| . |7-7| 
 - |0-0| Oh |1-1| , |2-2| it will |3-4| be difficult |5-6| to recognize |7-8| . |9-9| 
 - |0-0| So |1-2| you want to |3-4| force users to |5-8| adapt |9-10| depending on |11-13| what |14-15| the |16-16| machine can |17-18| or |19-19| cannot do |20-22| at some point |23-26| ? |27-27| 
 - |0-0| Not |1-1| necessarily |2-2| , |3-3| but |4-4| it is a |5-9| mutual |11-11| rapprochement |10-10| . |12-12| 
 I believe |0-1| that |2-2| very soon |3-4| we will have to |5-6| work on |7-8| the development |9-10| of |11-11| new types |12-13| of sensors |14-15| that will enable us to |16-19| better identify |20-21| human |24-26| reactions |22-23| . |27-27| 
 this may be |0-3| for example |4-5| of |6-6| laser |8-8| sensors |7-7| , |9-9| they produce |10-11| a pretty good |12-14| resolution |15-15| in |16-16| depth and |17-18| that is |19-20| very important |21-22| . |23-23| 
 - |0-0| If |1-1| there |2-2| is interested in |3-5| your work |6-7| on the |8-9| Xbox |11-11| Kinect |12-12| sensors |10-10| , |13-13| what do |14-18| you do not like |19-22| in the |23-24| modern |26-26| cameras |25-25| ? |27-27| 
 they lack |0-1| of |2-2| resolution |3-3| , |4-5| depth |6-6| or |7-9| something else |10-11| ? |12-12| 
 - |0-0| In principle |1-2| , |3-3| it is on |4-6| the |7-7| current generation |8-9| that |10-10| we use |11-13| in |14-14| our work |15-16| on |17-17| 3D |20-20| recognition |18-19| . |21-21| 
 obviously |2-2| , it would be |0-1| good |3-3| to get |4-5| about 8 |6-7| @-@ megapixel camera |8-8| with |9-9| a speed |10-11| of |12-12| 1000 |13-13| c |14-14| / s . |15-16| 
 but |0-0| the problem |1-2| is not |3-5| the |6-6| megapixel |7-7| themselves |8-10| , |11-11| but |12-13| the quality |14-15| of |16-16| the matrix |17-18| and depth |19-21| . |22-22| 
 compared |0-1| to |2-2| the last point |3-5| , |6-6| all |7-8| current technologies |9-10| are |11-11| good enough |12-13| , this |14-15| work |17-18| adds |16-16| to designers |19-20| of algorithms |21-22| . |23-23| 
 it should be borne in |0-3| mind |4-5| the resolution |6-7| X |8-11| and |12-12| Y |13-13| and |14-16| Z. |17-17| 
 the speed |0-1| is |2-2| also much |3-4| , |5-5| the number |6-7| of |8-8| executives |9-9| in |10-10| the second |11-12| . |13-13| 
 the |0-0| human |2-2| movements |1-1| are quite |3-4| dynamic |5-5| , |6-6| and |7-8| 30 |9-9| c |10-10| / o |11-12| do |13-14| not |16-16| really |15-15| , |17-17| especially for |18-19| the gestures |20-21| . |22-22| 
 Steven |0-0| Bathiche |1-1| , |2-3| our lab |4-5| in |6-6| Redmond |7-7| gave |8-9| to the touch |10-11| sensors |12-13| regular |16-16| delays |14-15| in treatment |17-18| between |19-20| 1 |21-21| and 100 |22-23| µs |24-24| , |25-25| current |28-28| sensors |26-27| being |29-29| closer to |30-32| the second |33-34| value |35-35| ( |36-36| 60 |37-37| @-@ 100 |38-39| ) |40-40| . |41-41| 
 everyone |0-2| does not understand |3-5| how |6-8| it influences |9-10| the interaction |11-12| of |13-13| man and |14-18| machine . |19-20| 
 I would have |0-2| needed a |3-5| device |6-6| of |7-7| this type |8-9| in |10-10| my work |11-12| , |13-13| but |14-14| not requiring |15-17| , |18-20| for more |21-24| frames |25-25| per second |26-28| . |29-29| 
 - |0-0| But |1-1| should not |2-6| increase the number |7-9| of cameras |10-11| ? |12-12| 
 - |0-0| The |1-1| Kinect |2-2| now has |3-5| three |6-6| &quot; |7-7| cameras |8-8| , |9-10| one of which |11-13| is |14-14| in fact |15-16| an |17-17| infrared |19-19| transmitter |18-18| and |20-20| the |21-21| second |22-22| , |23-23| a receiver |24-25| of the |26-26| reflected signal |27-28| . |29-29| 
 and |0-0| the third |1-2| is |4-4| in fact |5-6| a |7-7| camera |3-3| &apos;s |10-11| sensor |8-9| visible . |12-13| 
 it is not used to |0-4| define |5-5| the depth |6-7| of |8-8| the subject |9-10| . |11-11| 
 many |0-1| cameras |2-2| could |3-3| solve |4-4| this problem |5-6| ... |7-7| 
 or |0-1| worse |2-2| by increasing |3-4| the volume |5-6| required |7-7| of |8-8| calculations . |9-10| 
 it would be |0-1| interesting to |2-3| create a |4-5| flexible |7-7| product |6-6| similar to |8-9| Kinect |10-10| , |11-12| play |13-13| with |14-14| the curve |15-16| of the cameras |17-18| and |19-20| see how |21-22| it could |23-24| help |25-26| identify |27-27| the locations |28-29| . |30-30| 
 - |0-0| As far |1-1| as I remember |2-5| , Microsoft |6-7| , |8-8| unlike |9-12| Google , |13-14| has not |15-17| submitted |18-18| his glasses |19-20| to the public |21-22| . |23-23| 
 do you not think |0-4| that |5-5| from the point of view |6-10| of |11-11| the daily use |12-14| of |15-15| augmented reality |18-20| technology |16-17| , |21-21| the glasses |22-23| are |24-24| one of the |25-27| platforms |28-28| with |29-29| the greatest |30-32| prospects |33-33| ? |34-34| 
 - |0-0| Of course |1-2| , |3-3| walk |4-5| all the time |6-8| with |9-9| a smartphone |10-11| the |12-12| hands |13-14| is not practical |15-18| , but |19-19| here &apos;s |20-20| what |21-22| I think |23-24| : |25-25| the |26-26| best option |27-28| would be a |29-30| &quot; transitional |33-34| &quot; |35-35| augmented reality |31-32| that |36-36| you |37-37| would |38-38| from a |39-42| cloud |44-44| platform |43-43| to |45-46| glasses |47-48| in the |49-49| smartphone |50-50| . |51-51| 
 the glasses |0-1| are |2-2| a |3-3| very personal |5-6| device |4-4| and |7-7| that makes |8-12| their strength |13-14| ( |15-15| personal |18-18| items |16-17| are those |19-20| that |21-21| you are |22-23| the only one to |24-26| see |27-27| ) |28-28| and |29-29| at the same |30-31| time |32-32| their weakness |33-34| : |35-35| the |36-36| augmented reality |37-38| from the |39-41| glasses |42-42| will not allow you |43-46| to work |47-48| on |49-49| virtual objects |50-52| in collaboration |53-54| with other |55-57| people . |58-59| 
 - |0-0| Imagine |1-1| a moment |2-3| that |4-4| the manipulation |5-6| of |7-7| virtual |10-10| holographic |9-9| objects |8-8| in |11-11| the air |12-13| is no longer |14-16| accessible |17-17| only to |18-19| Tony |20-20| Stark |21-21| in |22-22| Iron |23-23| Man |24-24| , but also |25-26| to the |27-27| mere mortal |28-29| . |30-30| 
 there is |0-2| an issue |3-4| on which |5-6| the opponents of |7-9| this idea |10-11| pointing |12-12| the |13-13| finger |14-14| : |15-15| there is |16-19| no |20-21| tactile sensation |22-23| ! |24-24| 
 the hands |0-1| feel |2-3| nothing ! |4-5| 
 what answers |0-1| your group |2-3| prepare |4-8| compared |9-10| to |11-11| this challenge |12-13| ? |14-14| 
 - |0-0| In |1-1| my classes |2-3| , |4-4| I often say that |5-8| the |9-9| augmented reality |10-11| is the |12-13| seventh |14-14| breakthrough in |15-16| the interaction |17-18| between |19-19| man and machine |20-24| . |25-25| 
 I |0-0| think |1-2| the eighth |3-4| could |5-5| very well |6-7| be |8-8| the addition |9-10| of |11-11| tactile |13-13| sensations |12-12| . |14-14| 
 for |0-0| the moment |1-2| , |3-3| one |4-5| of the |6-6| interesting |8-8| techniques |7-7| is |9-9| the use |10-11| of |12-12| the second |13-14| hand |15-15| for |16-16| support |17-19| . |20-22| 
 it |0-0| is |1-1| perfectly |2-2| the pressure |3-4| ! |5-5| 
 but |0-0| there are also |1-5| technologies that |6-7| are actually |8-9| designed to |10-11| assign |12-12| the |13-14| palpability |15-15| these |16-17| images |19-19| &quot; |18-18| in |20-20| the air |21-22| &quot; |23-23| : |24-24| for example |25-26| the interference |27-28| of several |29-30| ultrasound |32-32| radiation |31-31| directed at |33-34| a |35-35| specific point |36-37| the |38-41| finger |42-42| and |43-43| that |44-44| gives you |45-46| the feeling |47-48| at the moment |49-52| still low |53-54| , |55-55| a |56-57| breath |58-58| of air |59-60| on the |61-62| fingertips |63-65| . |66-66| 
 there are also the |0-4| bracelets |5-5| worn |6-6| on the |7-8| wrist |9-9| that affect |10-12| the |13-13| nerve endings |14-15| of |16-16| fingers |17-17| , they |18-19| are also |20-21| a line of work |22-25| with |26-27| prospects |28-28| . |29-29| 
 - |0-0| And |1-1| you tried to |2-5| fool |6-6| the brain |7-8| ? |9-9| 
 make him |0-1| believe that he |2-4| feels |5-5| what he |6-8| would normally |9-10| feel |11-11| when |12-14| he sees |15-16| something |17-18| ? |19-19| 
 - |0-0| This is |1-1| a |2-2| good idea |3-4| , |5-5| we have not yet |6-10| tried |11-11| . |12-12| 
 there is still |0-3| a task |4-5| here |6-6| below |7-8| which |9-10| it will take |11-13| a long time |14-14| to |15-15| give |16-16| struggling |17-18| : |19-19| how to |20-23| believe in |24-25| someone |26-27| who |28-28| is physically located |29-31| in a |32-33| very small |35-36| space |34-34| that it |37-38| works |39-39| in an |40-41| almost infinite |44-45| open space |42-43| - |46-46| we are working |47-48| on |49-49| the concepts |50-51| of |52-52| treadmills |53-55| ( |56-56| nothing to |57-58| do with |59-60| those found |61-64| in |65-65| fitness |68-69| clubs |66-67| ) |70-70| , |71-72| mobile |74-74| platforms |73-73| and |75-75| also |76-76| of the |77-77| giant |79-79| balls |78-78| . |80-80| 
 for |0-0| the moment |1-2| , it |3-4| happens only |5-7| moderately |8-8| to |9-9| fool |10-10| the brain |11-12| , |13-13| there are still |14-17| many years |18-19| of work |20-21| . |22-22| 
 that is |0-0| what makes |1-3| the work |4-5| on the |6-7| virtual reality |8-9| so interesting |10-11| for |12-12| the researcher |13-14| : |15-15| many things |16-18| are |19-19| still in |20-21| the |22-22| absolute |24-24| state |23-23| of fertilization |25-26| . |27-27| 
 the reign |0-1| of taste |2-3| and |4-4| not the |5-7| culture - |8-9| Rosbalt.ru |10-10| 
 &quot; |0-0| Rosbalt |1-1| &quot; |2-2| continues |3-3| the project |4-5| &quot; |6-6| The |7-7| Petersburg |11-11| avant @-@ garde |8-10| &quot; dedicated |12-13| to the urban |14-15| that lie |16-18| ahead |19-20| , |21-21| at the forefront |22-26| of culture |27-29| and |30-31| the |32-32| arts . |33-33| 
 this |0-0| ultra |2-2| @-@ |3-3| selective |4-4| list |1-1| has |5-5| already hosted |6-7| leading |8-9| actors in |10-11| the art scene in |12-15| Saint |16-16| Petersburg |17-18| whose achievements |19-21| go beyond |22-26| the border |27-28| of |29-29| the city |30-31| and |32-32| who found |33-35| a |36-36| recognition |37-37| in Europe |38-39| , |40-40| after having |41-42| been |43-43| known |44-44| throughout |45-46| Russia |47-48| . |49-49| 
 the new |0-1| hero of |2-3| &quot; |4-4| Rosbalt |5-5| &quot; is |6-7| the painter |8-9| extrovert |10-10| Kirill |11-11| Miller |12-12| . |13-13| 
 the whole |0-1| town |2-2| knows |3-3| Kirill |4-4| Miller |5-5| , |6-6| bearded |10-10| man |7-8| rather |9-9| , |11-11| all |12-12| dressed in |15-15| red |13-14| that |16-17| can be crossed |18-20| near the |21-22| Russian |24-24| Museum |23-23| , |25-25| the |26-26| Summer |28-29| Garden |27-27| and parties |30-34| and |35-35| openings |36-36| connected |37-37| . |38-38| 
 the tables |0-1| of |2-2| Kirill |3-3| Miller |4-4| always |6-6| bring |5-5| crowds |7-8| , |9-9| regardless of their place |10-14| of exposure |15-16| . |17-17| 
 it is |0-1| one of the |2-4| St. Petersburg |6-6| storytellers |5-5| inherently |7-7| social and |8-9| philosophical , |10-11| one |12-13| of the founders |14-15| of the new |16-17| myths |18-18| . |19-19| 
 Kirill |0-0| Miller |1-1| is a distinguished |2-4| representative of |5-6| the |7-7| Petersburg |11-11| avant @-@ garde |8-10| of |12-12| the late |13-15| 1980s |16-17| and |18-19| early 1990s |20-23| . |24-24| 
 it is |0-1| also |2-2| a symbol |3-4| of |5-5| the city |6-7| , |8-8| its appearance |9-10| makes |11-11| people |13-14| smile |12-12| and |15-15| puts them |16-17| in a good mood . |18-21| 
 he |0-0| has recently |1-2| taken |3-3| in |4-4| his hands |5-6| a |7-7| barrel organ |8-10| and |11-11| it has become |12-14| the symbol |15-16| of |17-17| this instrument |18-19| in St. Petersburg |20-23| since he |24-25| had |26-26| matured |28-28| enough |27-27| for |29-29| this |30-30| difficult role |31-32| by virtue of |33-34| its existence |35-36| , |37-37| its philosophy |38-39| and |40-40| its |41-41| bohemian |44-44| image |42-43| . |45-45| 
 - |0-0| Kirill |1-1| , |2-2| why is it |3-6| that |7-7| you |8-8| run |9-9| the city |10-11| while |12-13| not |16-16| red |14-14| and |15-15| yellow or |17-20| blue |21-21| turquoise |22-22| , for example |23-24| ? |25-25| 
 I have chosen |0-3| red |4-5| as |6-6| designer |7-7| specializing in |8-9| the look and |10-12| the image |13-14| . |15-15| 
 in this |0-1| world , |2-3| red is |4-6| a compromise |7-8| between |9-9| the painter |10-11| , the |12-13| creator of |14-15| image and |16-17| society . |18-20| 
 although |0-1| in society |2-4| , |5-5| everything that |6-8| is not |9-11| grey |12-12| raises |13-13| aggressiveness |14-15| and |16-16| negative |19-19| agitation |17-18| . |20-20| 
 but |0-0| my |1-1| provocations |2-2| are intended |3-4| to start |5-6| the discussion |7-8| . |9-9| 
 the whole history |0-2| of my |3-4| provocative actions |5-6| is |7-7| an invitation |8-9| to |10-10| the discussion |11-12| . |13-13| 
 - |0-0| And |1-1| when |2-2| you |3-5| realize that |6-7| you |8-8| had to |9-9| be |10-10| a painter |11-11| ? |12-12| 
 - |0-0| At |1-1| the exposure |2-3| of the Palace |4-5| of |6-6| Culture |7-8| Nevskiy |9-9| where |10-12| my work |13-14| . |15-15| 
 I understood |0-2| that |3-3| it was |4-5| my |6-6| way |7-7| . |8-8| 
 then |0-0| , |1-1| the wave |2-3| of old |4-5| unofficial |7-8| painters |6-6| had passed |9-10| and |11-11| the new |12-13| , |14-14| free , |15-16| in my |17-18| kind |19-19| , |20-20| were |21-21| misunderstood |22-22| . |23-23| 
 I started |0-3| making friends with |4-8| the |9-9| painters |10-10| of the |11-12| new wave |13-14| , |15-15| with those |16-17| of the |18-19| Postgazonevchtchina |20-20| that gave birth to |21-25| &quot; |26-26| Pouchinskaya |27-27| @-@ 10 |28-29| &quot; and |30-31| then |32-32| there |33-35| has |36-36| been no |37-39| wave |40-40| . |41-41| 
 I |0-0| am interested |1-2| in |3-3| theatre |4-4| , |5-6| fashion |7-8| , |9-9| music , |10-14| all |15-16| types |17-17| except |18-18| for the |19-19| words . |20-21| 
 - |0-0| And |1-1| it all |2-3| ended up |4-6| in your |7-8| artistic |10-10| Clinic |9-9| ... |11-11| - It |12-13| was important |14-15| for me to be |16-20| at the centre |21-22| of the |23-24| culture of |25-26| Saint |27-27| Petersburg |28-29| where |30-30| must |31-31| meet |32-33| the best |34-35| creative forces |36-37| . |38-38| 
 in 1995 |0-1| , |2-2| I have |3-5| taken |6-6| place at |7-8| Pushkinskaya |9-9| @-@ 10 |10-11| home |12-13| before |14-14| the work |15-16| a |17-17| musical |19-19| and artistic |20-21| club |18-18| , |22-22| a |23-23| bohemian |25-25| club |24-24| , |26-26| the home |27-28| of the |29-30| Petersburg |32-32| bohemians |31-31| . |33-33| 
 many |0-0| were born |1-3| : |4-4| the |5-5| NOM , |6-7| Tequila |8-8| @-@ |9-9| jazz |10-10| , I |11-12| can still see |13-14| Chnour |15-15| arrive |16-16| with |17-17| the project |18-19| &quot; |20-20| The |21-21| Van |24-24| Gogh |25-25| &apos;s ear |22-23| . &quot; |26-27| 
 Chnour |0-0| and |1-1| his friends |2-3| sang |4-4| songs |5-6| easily |7-7| during playback |8-11| in |12-13| tight |15-15| shirts |14-14| , they |16-17| were among |18-19| them |20-20| Igor |21-21| Vdovin , |22-23| composer |24-24| fashionable |27-29| today |25-26| . |30-30| 
 when |0-0| the group |1-2| began |3-4| to |5-5| happen |6-7| live |8-9| , |10-10| he |11-11| became |12-13| &quot; |14-14| Leningrad |15-15| . &quot; |16-17| 
 Trakhtenberg |0-0| animated |1-1| of |2-4| emissions |5-5| before |6-6| the time |7-8| of |9-9| Hali |10-10| Gali . |11-12| 
 we gave them |0-3| Trakhtenberg |4-4| and |5-5| it was then that |6-9| his great |10-11| career |12-12| began |13-14| , |15-15| but |16-16| his training |17-18| and |19-20| basic education , |21-24| it is |25-26| here |27-28| that he |29-30| received them |31-33| . |34-34| 
 &quot; |1-1| D137 |2-2| alto |0-0| , &quot; |3-4| Club |5-5| &quot; |6-6| Griboedov |7-7| &quot; |8-8| : |9-9| these are |10-11| the impact |12-13| of the |14-15| artistic |17-17| Clinic |16-16| . |18-18| 
 our |0-0| employees |1-2| are |3-4| as |5-7| accustomed to . |8-9| 
 I |0-0| am |1-1| a hero |2-3| of the |4-4| past century |5-6| , |7-8| the |9-9| time when |10-11| the culture |12-13| meant |14-15| something |16-17| . |18-18| 
 in 2000 |0-1| , |2-2| a survey |3-4| was |5-6| conducted |7-7| in |8-8| the press |9-10| : |11-11| it was |12-13| the price |14-15| &quot; |16-16| The |17-17| personalities |18-18| of |19-19| our city |20-21| . &quot; |22-23| 
 I was appointed |0-3| &quot; |4-4| Painter |5-5| of |6-6| the year |7-8| , &quot; |9-10| and |11-11| it was then that |12-15| my |16-16| reign |17-17| ended |18-20| . |21-21| 
 it is not |0-3| convenient |4-4| to work |5-6| in |7-7| a new |8-9| era |10-10| with |11-12| old rules |13-14| , I |15-16| am |17-17| a representative |18-19| of truth |20-22| , |23-24| honesty |25-26| and culture |27-30| of the |31-31| past century |32-33| . |34-34| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| it is |3-4| easy to |5-6| become |7-7| popular , |8-9| but |10-10| the culture |11-12| and popularity |13-15| are |16-16| different things , |17-20| it may |21-22| be |23-23| popular , |24-25| but |26-26| not really |27-28| a person |29-30| of |31-31| culture |32-32| . |33-33| 
 - |0-0| Your |1-1| work |2-2| is characterized |3-4| by a |5-6| recognizable |8-8| style |7-7| . |9-9| 
 - |0-0| Many |1-1| of |2-2| my paintings |3-4| are |5-6| hits |7-7| , |8-8| they have |9-10| a |11-11| news |12-12| and |13-13| a |14-14| very strong |16-17| acuity |15-15| . |18-18| 
 I will |0-1| have |2-2| an exhibit |3-5| &quot; |6-6| The |7-7| Russian museum |8-9| through |10-11| the clowns |12-13| . &quot; |14-15| 
 the clowns |0-1| belong to |2-3| a |4-4| timeless |6-6| category |5-5| . |7-7| 
 before |0-0| I was |1-2| someone |3-4| of |5-5| social , |6-7| today |8-9| it hurts |10-12| and |13-13| it &apos;s scary |14-16| to be |17-18| so . |19-20| 
 but |0-0| with |1-1| the clowns |2-3| , |4-5| fades |6-7| , |8-8| the tragic |9-10| falls |11-11| . |12-12| 
 I love |0-1| the |2-2| grotesque , |3-4| I have |5-6| ideas |7-8| grotesque |9-9| . |10-10| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| the idea |3-4| of saving |5-6| the world |7-8| via the |9-10| total |12-12| disguise |11-11| and compulsory |13-14| . |15-15| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| it is the dress |3-6| that |7-7| is important |8-8| , it |9-10| is interested in the |11-13| mechanism |14-14| outside , |15-16| but not |17-18| inside |19-22| the person |23-24| . |25-25| 
 maybe |0-3| you can &apos;t |4-7| give him |8-9| a hand |10-11| , |12-12| but |13-15| rather |16-17| to |18-18| spit |19-19| in |20-20| the |21-21| face |22-22| . |23-23| 
 and |0-0| the lies |1-2| will be |3-3| erased |4-4| by the |5-6| disguise |7-7| . |8-8| 
 - |0-0| Recently |1-1| we |2-3| have seen |4-5| in |6-6| the role |7-8| of the |9-9| organ grinder |10-14| . |15-15| - A |16-17| cultural city |18-19| must have |20-21| this kind |22-23| of |24-24| hero . |25-26| 
 who |0-0| else can |1-5| play it . |6-8| 
 - |0-0| But |1-1| maybe |2-5| commercial |8-8| art |6-7| can also |9-10| be |11-11| beautiful |12-12| ? |13-13| 
 - |0-0| Today |1-2| commercial |5-5| art |3-4| must |6-6| be |7-7| treated |8-8| , |9-9| delicate |10-10| , |11-11| sweet wine |12-12| . |13-13| 
 a |0-0| disintegration of |1-2| the culture |3-4| is |5-5| happening |6-10| . |11-11| 
 before |0-0| , people |1-3| were divided |4-5| in |6-6| herds |7-7| , supporters |8-10| of the |11-12| bohemian |13-13| liked |14-14| something |15-16| , |17-17| the |18-18| corny |19-19| another |20-21| . |22-22| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| everything is |3-4| divided into |5-6| micro |7-7| @-@ |8-8| communities , |9-10| it is |11-12| difficult to |13-14| please everyone |15-19| . |20-20| 
 I |0-0| am not |1-3| a ticket |4-5| to |6-6| one hundred dollars |7-8| to please |9-11| everyone |12-14| . |15-15| 
 today |0-1| , we need to |2-4| think about |5-6| who |7-7| you &apos;re going |8-9| . |10-11| 
 each |0-0| has |1-2| 100 |3-3| fans |4-4| . |5-5| 
 - |0-0| But |1-1| many thousands |2-3| of people |4-5| come to see |6-7| Stas |8-8| by Piedmontese forces |9-9| ! |10-10| 
 - |0-0| These are |1-2| people |3-4| that |5-5| were |6-7| thrown |8-8| to come |9-10| see it |11-12| , |13-13| it is the |14-16| sexual |18-18| and social |19-20| side |17-17| that works |21-22| . |23-23| 
 but |0-0| for the |1-2| cultural side |3-4| , |5-5| 300 people |6-7| will come , |8-9| 10 |10-10| miles |11-11| will not come |12-14| and |15-15| in the end |16-19| it is |20-21| less |22-23| management , |24-25| money |26-27| , everything |28-29| is languishing |30-30| . |31-31| 
 I have |0-1| my |2-2| fans |3-3| , |4-4| the key |5-6| is |7-8| not to |9-12| deceive |13-13| , |14-14| not to |15-17| spoil |18-18| the experience |19-20| . |21-21| 
 when I was young |0-3| , |4-4| I painted |5-6| tables |7-8| that |9-9| a collector |10-11| has |12-12| hung |13-13| beside |14-16| Falk |17-17| or |18-19| Larionov |20-20| . |21-21| 
 I started |0-2| with |3-3| the tables |4-5| that |6-6| usually |7-8| are |9-9| those |10-12| painted |13-13| at the end of life |14-17| . |18-18| 
 today |0-1| , it is |2-3| often confused |4-5| ideas |6-7| . |8-8| 
 it |0-0| said |1-1| : |2-2| there are |3-5| spiritual |8-8| culture |6-7| , |9-9| the culture |10-11| of consumption |12-13| . |14-14| 
 consumption |0-1| has no |2-5| culture |6-6| , |7-7| it has nothing |8-11| to do |12-13| . |14-14| 
 I |0-0| am a |1-2| representative of |3-4| the culture |5-6| of yesterday |7-8| , |9-9| I grew up |10-12| with |13-13| the example |14-15| of the |16-16| painters |17-17| who lived |18-19| in poverty |20-22| and |23-23| died |24-24| in poverty |25-27| and |28-28| who refused |29-30| the money |31-32| just |33-33| for |34-34| painting |35-36| . |37-37| 
 I |0-0| am |1-1| for |2-2| this culture |3-4| . |5-5| 
 - |0-0| Kirill |1-1| , |2-2| what is |3-6| lacking |7-8| in St. Petersburg |9-12| ? |13-13| 
 - |0-1| good |2-2| cultural |4-4| experts |3-3| . |5-5| 
 there is |0-2| this concept |3-4| : |5-5| the official |6-7| culture |8-10| . |11-11| 
 but |0-0| not everyone can |1-4| work in |5-6| the culture |7-8| . |9-9| 
 under |0-0| the reign |1-2| of |3-3| good |4-4| tsars |5-5| , |6-6| it wasn &apos;t |7-10| like that |11-12| , |13-13| the Tsars |14-15| did not understand |16-19| the culture |20-21| , |22-22| but |23-23| they understood |24-25| the need to |26-28| keep |29-29| the good |30-31| experts . |32-33| 
 in Moscow |0-1| , |2-2| there are |3-5| now |6-7| good |8-9| consultants |10-10| . |11-11| 
 we have |0-1| people |2-3| here |4-4| in St. Petersburg |5-8| that could |9-10| be |11-11| experts , |12-13| but |14-14| they are |15-16| excluded |17-17| , |18-18| because |19-19| we need |20-22| higher |24-25| experts |23-23| who |26-26| will assess |27-27| correctly |28-28| these experts |29-30| and |31-32| pave |33-33| a path |34-35| . |36-36| 
 currently |0-0| , |1-1| it is the |2-4| &quot; |5-5| reign |6-6| of taste |7-8| &quot; |9-9| which blooms |10-11| . |12-12| 
 the same |0-1| Erarta |2-2| , |3-3| but |4-4| they |5-6| differ |7-7| in that they |8-12| honestly |14-14| say |13-13| that they |15-16| do not take |17-19| any |20-20| contemporary art |21-23| , |24-24| there are |25-29| painters |30-30| who have to |31-33| find other |34-36| museums |37-37| . |38-38| 
 - |0-0| For |1-1| you , |2-3| what is |4-8| it is |9-10| St. Petersburg |11-13| ? |14-14| 
 - |0-0| St. Petersburg |1-3| is not |4-6| the cultural capital |7-9| , |10-10| in Moscow , |14-15| there is |11-13| far more |16-18| culture |19-19| , |20-20| there is a |21-24| ground |25-25| for that . |26-28| 
 and |0-0| on |1-1| our |2-2| stones |3-3| , art |4-6| is struggling to |7-10| grow |11-11| . |12-12| 
 we need a |0-4| cultural |6-6| soil |5-5| and |7-7| we have |8-9| more |10-11| writers |12-12| than |13-14| readers , |15-16| it &apos;s |17-18| bad . |19-20| 
 in Europe |0-1| , |2-2| there are a lot of |3-7| curious |8-8| which |9-9| will |10-10| see |11-11| exhibitions , concerts |12-16| . |17-17| 
 for |0-0| us , |1-2| this |3-3| is |5-5| very thin |6-7| layer |4-4| . |8-8| 
 we must |0-1| make the |2-3| fashionable |5-7| art , |4-4| as was the case |8-12| at the beginning |13-14| of the |15-15| last century |16-17| . |18-18| 
 project carried out |0-1| with |2-2| the support |3-4| of the award |5-7| of |8-8| St. Petersburg |9-11| 
 birth |0-0| in space |1-3| 
 the Earth |0-1| is |2-2| in danger |3-4| . |5-5| 
 global warming |0-1| or |2-2| collision with |3-4| an asteroid |5-6| . |7-8| 
 caravans |0-1| of |2-2| space shuttles |3-4| with |5-5| landlubbers |6-7| on |8-9| leave in search |10-13| of a |14-15| planet |16-16| . |17-19| 
 to save |0-1| humanity |2-3| , |4-4| a |5-5| big question |6-7| arises |8-9| : how to |10-11| continue |12-12| to |13-14| live |15-15| our species |16-17| in weightlessness |18-19| or |20-21| on |22-22| a planet |23-24| of |25-25| relief |26-26| ? |27-27| 
 I believe |0-1| that there is |2-5| not much |6-7| choice |8-9| . |10-10| 
 there are |0-2| in fact |3-4| two |5-5| real |6-6| planets |7-7| that we can |8-11| win |12-12| , |13-13| if only |14-18| by |19-19| hypothesis . |20-21| 
 &quot; |0-0| this is |1-4| Venus |5-5| and |6-7| Mars |8-8| , &quot; |9-10| said |11-11| Vladimir |12-12| mute |13-13| , |14-14| researcher at |15-16| the Institute |17-18| of Astronomy |19-19| of State |20-21| P.K. |22-22| Chternberg |23-23| ( |24-24| GAICh |25-25| ) |26-26| . |27-27| 
 if |0-0| the conditions |3-4| on Mars |1-2| are more |5-6| suited |7-7| for |8-8| life , |9-11| the temperature at |12-14| the surface |15-16| of |17-17| Venus |18-18| is 500 |19-21| . |22-22| 
 we cannot |0-2| live there |3-4| than at |5-6| very |7-7| high altitudes |8-9| or |10-10| on |11-11| the orbit |12-13| of |14-14| Venus |15-15| ... |16-16| in space |17-19| . |20-20| 
 it |0-0| began |1-2| to |3-3| focus on |4-6| issues of |7-8| reproduction |9-10| in space |11-13| by focusing on |14-17| the flora |18-19| . |20-20| 
 there is still |0-3| a |4-4| half @-@ |5-6| century |7-7| , it |8-9| was conducting |10-10| experiments |11-12| on plants |13-15| . |16-16| 
 four generations |0-1| of peas |2-4| grown |5-5| in orbit |6-7| were |8-10| in |11-11| no way |12-13| on |14-14| earth |16-16| varieties |15-15| . |17-17| 
 then |0-0| , |1-1| it was |2-3| put |4-4| into orbit |5-6| of |7-7| insects |8-8| , small |9-11| breeding |14-14| Drosophila |13-13| flies |12-12| . |15-15| 
 in 1979 |0-1| , |2-2| quail |5-6| eggs |3-4| were sent |7-9| into space |10-12| to |13-13| see how |14-15| developed |16-17| an embryo |18-19| in weightlessness |20-21| . |22-22| 
 you get |0-1| to |2-2| exit |3-4| a chick |5-6| perfectly normal |7-10| . |11-11| 
 it |0-0| is then |1-2| that |3-3| the problems start |4-6| . |7-7| 
 &quot; |0-0| the problem |1-2| is |3-3| related to the fact that |4-7| the chick |8-9| must find |10-11| a support |12-13| , it |14-15| must be |16-17| put |18-18| on |19-19| his |20-20| legs |21-21| and |22-22| start moving |23-25| , &quot; |26-27| says |28-28| the laboratory director |29-32| of |33-33| the Institute |34-35| of |36-36| Medical @-@ |38-39| Biological |40-40| Problems |37-37| of the |41-42| Russian Academy of Sciences |43-47| ( BOPI |48-49| ) |50-50| Vladimir |51-51| force |52-52| . |53-53| 
 as |0-0| there is |1-2| no support |3-4| , |5-5| the chicks |6-7| flapping |8-9| in a disorderly way |10-12| . |13-13| 
 and |0-0| after 10 |1-4| p.m. |5-5| , |6-6| the new |7-8| born |9-9| saw |10-10| their |11-11| entirely |13-13| atrophying |14-15| instincts |12-12| . |16-16| 
 the chicks |0-1| did |2-2| not |4-4| react |3-3| to |5-5| light |6-7| and |8-9| sound . |10-11| 
 unfortunately , |0-1| they |2-2| died |3-3| just |4-5| after |6-8| four |9-9| days |10-10| . |11-11| 
 &quot; |0-0| we |1-3| now offer |4-4| our eyes |5-6| twice |7-8| , then |9-10| we abandoned |11-13| , because |14-15| it is |16-17| simply impossible |18-20| to work |21-22| with them |23-24| , &quot; |25-29| said |30-30| Vladimir |31-31| force |32-32| by noting |33-34| the failure |35-36| of |37-37| the experience |38-39| with |40-40| chicks |41-42| in space |43-45| . |46-46| 
 the last |0-1| &quot; |2-2| miniature |4-4| ark |3-3| &quot; organic |5-6| with animals |7-9| was sent |10-12| into orbit |13-14| 16 years |18-19| ago |15-17| . |20-20| 
 the experiments |0-1| will continue |2-3| in the spring of |4-5| 2013 |6-6| . |7-7| 
 however |0-0| , the |1-2| &quot; |4-4| &quot; |6-7| biosatellite |3-3| Bion |5-5| spacecraft will carry |8-8| that |9-9| species |10-11| of the same sex |12-14| . |15-15| 
 there has been |0-3| an experiment |4-5| with |6-6| rats |7-8| sent |9-9| with |10-10| their |11-11| fetus |12-12| in space |13-15| . |16-16| 
 in principle |0-1| , |2-2| it |3-4| discovered |5-6| nothing |7-8| supernatural . |9-10| 
 &quot; |0-0| it was |1-3| still |4-5| biosatellites |6-6| and |7-7| then |8-8| it is |9-10| the only |11-12| experience . |13-14| we must |15-16| do this kind of |17-20| research |21-21| , &quot; |22-23| said |24-25| Vladimir |26-26| force |27-27| . |28-28| 
 after |0-0| landing |1-2| , |3-3| the |4-4| space |6-8| rats |5-5| gave |9-10| birth to |11-12| their offspring |13-14| . |15-15| 
 nevertheless |0-0| , it |1-2| does |3-4| not yet |5-6| to |7-7| make |8-9| reproductions |10-10| directly |11-11| into space |12-14| . |15-15| 
 this is not an |0-4| easy task |5-6| . |7-7| 
 by losing |0-1| their |2-2| usual |4-4| environment |3-3| , animals |5-7| are no longer |8-10| able |11-12| to realize |13-14| their |15-15| sexual |17-17| instincts |16-16| . |18-18| 
 unlike |0-1| animals |2-2| , |3-3| the man |4-5| is |6-7| capable |8-8| , |9-9| in principle |10-11| . |12-12| 
 Homo |0-1| sapiens |2-2| possesses |3-3| the |4-4| abstract thinking |5-6| , |7-7| he |8-8| is able |9-10| to create |11-12| a |13-13| suitable |16-16| emotional |15-15| background |14-14| . |17-17| 
 this type |0-1| of experience |2-3| is not |4-6| done |7-7| for ethical reasons |8-11| . |12-12| 
 but |0-0| women |1-2| are |3-3| in space |4-6| for 50 years . |7-11| 
 the biggest |0-2| risk |3-3| was |4-5| taken |6-6| by |7-7| Tereshkova |8-8| . |9-9| 
 and |0-0| the |1-1| female |3-3| body |2-2| is what |4-6| humanity &apos;s most |7-11| precious . |12-13| 
 the |0-0| gull |1-1| flew |2-4| and |5-5| person |6-6| on Earth |7-8| could not |9-10| say |11-11| whether he |12-13| would hold |14-14| after |15-15| a flight |16-17| into space |18-20| . |21-21| 
 if |0-0| she |1-1| could |2-3| give |4-4| birth to |5-6| a child |7-8| after |9-9| the flight . |10-11| 
 &quot; |0-0| nobody |1-2| responded to |3-4| this issue |5-6| , &quot; |7-8| said |9-9| Vakhtang |10-10| Vatchnadzé |11-11| , |12-12| retired |13-13| from |14-16| rockets |17-17| and space |18-21| . |22-22| 
 in June |0-1| 1964 |2-2| , just |3-4| a |5-5| year after |6-7| his flight |8-9| in space |10-12| , |13-13| the |14-14| first woman |15-16| cosmonaut |17-17| Valentina |18-18| Tereshkova |19-19| gave |20-20| birth to |21-22| a |23-23| baby girl |24-25| . |26-26| 
 the child &apos;s father |0-4| , |5-5| was |8-8| also |9-9| cosmonaut |10-10| Andrian |6-6| Nikolayev |7-7| . |11-11| 
 in 1988 |0-1| , |2-2| the second |3-4| woman |5-5| cosmonaut |6-6| Svetlana |7-7| Savitskaya |8-8| , |9-9| after being |10-12| twice |13-14| in orbit |15-16| and |17-17| have |18-18| even |19-19| worked |20-21| extra @-@ |23-24| vehicular |25-25| environment |22-22| , |26-26| gave |27-27| birth to |28-29| a son |30-31| . |32-32| 
 however , |0-1| the risk |2-3| persists |4-4| . |5-5| 
 we have |0-1| little |2-2| , even |3-4| very few |5-7| cosmonauts |8-8| who |9-9| had nothing |10-13| and give |14-16| birth to |17-18| a |19-19| healthy |21-23| offspring |20-20| after long |24-26| flights . |27-28| 
 &quot; and |0-1| if they |2-3| are longer |4-6| , it |7-8| presents |9-9| a danger |10-11| even during |12-13| flights |14-15| in orbit |16-17| , &quot; |18-19| concludes |20-20| the pilot |21-22| and |23-23| astronaut |24-24| , |25-25| hero of |26-27| the Soviet Union |28-30| and |31-31| Russia &apos;s |33-35| hero |32-32| , |36-36| Valery |37-37| Poliakov |38-38| . |39-39| 
 yet , |0-1| humanity |2-3| must |4-4| seek |5-6| new solutions |7-8| in |9-9| biotechnology |10-11| , |12-12| radiation protection |13-17| and |18-18| the creation |19-20| of an |21-22| artificial |24-24| gravity |23-23| . |25-25| 
 the Centre |3-4| for Hydrology |1-2| laboratory |0-0| prepared |5-6| cosmonauts |7-8| : |9-9| mandatory stage |10-11| of |12-12| preparation |13-14| . |15-16| 
 here |0-0| , in |1-2| neutral buoyancy |3-4| , |5-5| cosmonauts |6-7| train |8-9| to |10-10| extra @-@ vehicular |12-14| exits |11-11| . |15-15| 
 water |0-1| mimics |2-2| weightlessness |3-4| . |5-5| 
 if |0-0| for |1-1| adults |2-3| , |4-4| the water |5-6| is comfortable |7-8| but |9-10| a foreign environment |11-13| , |14-14| for infants |15-17| , |18-18| it is |19-20| their true |21-22| element . |23-24| 
 the small |0-1| amphibious |3-3| men |2-2| seem to |4-4| confirm this |5-6| : |7-7| life on Earth |8-11| is from |12-13| the ocean |14-15| . |16-16| 
 to the extent that |0-3| the baby |4-5| is |6-6| about 9 |7-8| months |9-9| in the |10-11| lymphatic |13-13| fluid |12-12| from the |14-14| womb |15-18| , |19-19| it |20-21| is easier to |22-25| get used |26-27| to |28-29| the water |30-31| . |32-32| 
 it is |0-1| logical |4-4| in principle |2-3| , because |5-6| since its |7-8| birth |9-9| until |10-11| his first |12-13| bath |14-14| , it |15-16| happens |17-18| only |19-19| 2 |20-20| weeks |21-21| . |22-22| 
 &quot; it |0-1| is very |2-3| little to |4-5| forget |6-6| , &quot; |7-8| explains |9-9| the |10-10| infant |14-15| swimming |12-13| instructor |11-11| , Marina |16-17| Aksenova |18-18| . |19-19| 
 in a word |0-2| , |3-3| if |4-4| for |5-5| the child |6-7| who |8-8| has just been born |9-11| weightlessness |12-13| is |14-14| a more natural state |15-18| , |19-19| the |20-20| woman |21-21| needs |22-24| gravitation |25-25| , |26-27| a force |28-29| of |30-30| weight . |31-32| 
 in |0-0| zero gravity |1-1| , |2-2| the muscles |3-4| of the |5-5| abdomen |6-6| , pelvis |7-9| atrophy |10-11| very quickly |12-13| , |14-14| the |15-15| ability to |16-17| push |18-18| the |19-19| baby |20-20| is lost |21-22| . |23-23| 
 OK , |0-3| do not know |4-4| it |5-5| based |6-8| on the |9-10| birthing |12-13| simulators |11-11| . |14-14| 
 of course , you can |0-3| prepare |4-4| a baby |5-6| in a |7-8| special chamber |9-10| , |11-11| the |12-12| woman |13-13| will |14-15| get him out |16-18| . |19-19| 
 &quot; and |0-1| then |2-2| ? |3-3| &quot; |4-4| asked |5-5| Valery |6-6| Poliakov |7-7| to |8-8| invite |9-9| to |10-10| reflect on |11-12| this complex issue |13-15| . |16-16| 
 on the other hand |0-3| , |4-4| the child |5-6| also |7-7| needs an |8-11| artificial |13-13| gravity |12-12| . |14-14| 
 if he |0-1| does not feel |2-4| the |5-5| earth &apos;s |7-7| attraction |6-6| , |8-8| the agency |9-10| does not form |11-13| the skeleton |14-15| nor the |16-17| muscular system |18-19| . |20-20| 
 you can &apos;t |0-3| dress |4-4| an infant |5-6| as |7-7| an adult |8-9| with |10-10| a |11-11| special |13-13| combination |12-12| for |14-14| workouts |15-16| . |17-17| 
 it |0-0| will simply be |1-3| deprived of |4-5| their basic needs . |6-9| 
 &quot; and |0-1| this experience |2-3| that |4-4| we would consider |5-6| in |7-7| this case |8-9| by imagining |10-11| the birth |12-13| of a child |14-16| in a |17-18| foreign |20-20| environment |19-19| will lead |21-21| to the return |22-23| to Earth |24-25| of a |26-27| disabled child |28-29| , |30-30| entirely |31-31| désadapté |32-32| , &quot; |33-34| provides |35-35| the Director |36-37| of the |38-38| Committee |39-39| on Bioethics |40-42| Institute |43-45| of |46-46| Medico @-@ |48-49| Biological |50-50| Problems |47-47| of the |51-52| Russian Academy of Sciences |53-57| , |58-58| Igor |59-59| Pestov |60-60| . |61-61| 
 the birth |0-1| of children |2-3| in space |4-6| is |7-7| still |8-9| the theory |10-11| . |12-12| 
 however , |0-1| over time |2-4| it will become |5-6| reality , |7-8| where the |9-10| Terrans |11-11| will visit |12-14| their |15-15| shuttles |16-16| to a |17-18| distant |20-20| planet |19-19| , which |21-21| will become |22-22| the habitat |23-24| of |25-25| their offspring |26-27| born |28-28| in space |29-31| . |32-32| 
 the head |0-1| of the |2-3| Supreme Audit Institution |6-9| ( |5-5| SAI |4-4| ) |10-13| said |14-15| : |16-16| &quot; |17-17| the control |18-19| of the |20-20| pseudo |21-21| self @-@ employment |22-23| ( |24-24| in Czech |25-26| &quot; |27-27| Švarc |29-29| system |28-28| &quot; ) |30-31| failed |32-33| because |34-35| of politicians |36-37| . |38-38| 
 in |0-0| the area of public procurement |1-5| , |6-6| the |7-7| Czech |9-9| Republic |8-8| has |10-11| competent inspectors |12-13| and |14-15| quality |18-19| legislation |16-17| but it |20-21| is |22-22| lagging behind |23-25| in terms |26-29| of |30-30| its application |31-32| . |33-33| 
 that is |0-1| what |2-3| said |4-5| Miloslav |6-6| Kala |7-7| , the |8-9| vice |10-10| @-@ |11-11| president of |12-13| the |14-14| Supreme Audit Institution |15-18| of public finances |19-21| in an interview |22-24| for |25-25| Aktuálně.cz. |26-26| 
 &quot; |0-0| the law |1-2| will never be |3-5| perfect , |6-7| but |8-8| its application |9-10| must |11-11| be fair |12-13| and |14-14| , |15-15| in my opinion |16-18| , |19-19| this is |20-21| what is missing |22-25| here |26-27| , &quot; said |28-31| Kala |32-32| in his |33-34| commentary on |35-36| the |37-37| current situation |38-39| . |40-40| 
 a |0-0| joint |2-3| control |1-1| by |4-5| German |9-9| and Czech |7-8| inspectors |6-6| also suggests |10-11| similar conclusions . |12-15| 
 he cited |0-1| as an example |2-3| of |4-4| abusive practice |5-6| the approach |7-8| of the |9-9| &quot; system |10-11| &quot; |13-13| by |14-14| Petr |15-15| Nečas |16-16| Švarc |12-12| . |17-17| 
 Prime |0-2| Minister |3-3| said recently |4-6| that |7-7| the |8-9| ODS |10-10| would not |11-13| disturb |14-14| the entrepreneurs |15-16| with |17-17| controls |18-19| ; |20-20| is it |21-24| permitted |25-25| or |26-26| prohibited ? |27-28| 
 &quot; |0-0| the law |1-2| must |3-3| be |4-5| applied |6-6| in one way or |7-11| another |12-13| , |14-14| so if |15-16| it prohibits |17-18| something |19-20| , even |21-22| the head of government |23-26| cannot |27-28| prevent |29-31| an authority |32-34| to |35-36| inspect |37-37| to demand |38-39| respect for |40-42| the law |43-44| , &quot; |45-46| said |47-47| Kala |48-48| . |49-49| 
 at the meeting |0-3| of the |4-5| supervisory |7-8| committee |6-6| in |9-9| the Chamber of Deputies |10-13| , |14-14| you mentioned |15-17| a |18-18| Czech @-@ |20-21| German |22-22| project |19-19| in which |23-26| were compared |27-29| the laws |30-31| on public procurement |32-36| of these |37-38| two countries |39-40| . |41-41| 
 what |0-1| was it |2-4| actually |6-6| matter |5-5| ? |7-7| 
 it is a |0-4| parallel |6-6| control |5-5| that |7-7| we have |8-9| launched |10-13| about |14-16| two |17-17| years ago |18-18| . |19-19| 
 in simple terms |0-2| , |3-3| European |6-6| legislation |4-5| provides for |7-7| how to |8-10| manage the |11-12| public |14-14| markets |13-13| and |15-15| specific national laws |16-19| and an |20-22| actual |24-25| practice |23-23| to |26-26| follow |27-28| . |29-29| 
 we gathered |0-2| all this |3-4| and |5-5| although |6-7| this monitoring procedure |8-11| is not |12-14| yet complete |15-16| , |17-17| very interesting |20-21| differences |18-19| we |22-22| have emerged |23-24| : |25-25| generally |26-26| speaking |27-27| , |28-28| our legislation |29-30| is |31-31| perhaps |32-34| more severe |36-37| &quot; |35-35| and better quality |38-41| , &quot; |42-43| however , |44-45| according to |46-46| certain parameters |47-48| , |49-49| the practice |50-51| itself is |52-54| better |55-55| in Germany |56-57| . |58-58| 
 this confirms |0-1| that |2-3| it is not enough |4-7| to |8-8| continually |10-11| develop |9-9| increasingly detailed |13-17| rules |12-12| , but |18-18| that it |19-20| is necessary |21-22| to focus on |23-26| implementing |27-30| the |31-32| law . |33-34| 
 how |0-1| can this project |2-6| help you |7-8| in practice |9-9| and that |10-11| result is |12-13| there |14-17| for you |18-19| ? |20-20| 
 a |0-0| common control |1-2| of |3-3| this type |4-5| should |6-7| help |8-11| us |12-14| strive to |15-17| clarify |18-18| the laws |19-20| , |21-21| to decline |22-23| and improve |24-26| the thresholds |27-28| , |29-29| when it |30-31| does not have |32-34| a |35-35| really |37-37| positive |38-38| effect |36-36| . |39-39| 
 the principle |0-1| of good management |2-4| means |5-5| getting |6-6| the thing |7-10| at a reasonable price |11-14| ( |15-15| which |16-17| does not always mean |18-22| the |23-23| lowest |24-25| ) |26-26| , |27-27| in order |28-28| to exclude |29-30| any |31-31| enrichment |32-32| and |33-33| a possible |34-35| criminal activity |36-37| . |38-38| 
 but |0-0| by lowering |1-2| the thresholds |3-4| of the markets |5-6| , it |7-8| will not |9-11| necessarily |12-12| this goal |13-14| . |15-15| 
 it could be that |0-3| this system |4-5| is |6-7| so |8-10| overwhelmed by |11-12| paperwork |13-14| , |15-15| that |16-16| those who |17-19| seek |20-20| loopholes |21-22| will find |23-23| many |24-24| more opportunities |25-27| than |28-28| if |29-29| the threshold |30-31| had remained |32-33| above |34-35| . |36-36| 
 you talk about |0-2| internal problems |3-4| concerning |5-5| the implementation |6-9| of |10-10| public procurement legislation |11-15| . |16-16| 
 how does |0-1| the control system |2-5| in Germany |6-7| ? |8-8| 
 is there |0-4| a |5-5| similar |7-7| institution |6-6| in our |8-9| ISC |10-10| or |11-11| a |12-12| different |16-16| mode of |13-14| organization |15-15| ? |17-17| 
 in terms |0-3| of institutions |4-5| , |6-6| similarly |7-7| to |8-8| the ISC |9-10| , |11-11| works |12-12| there |13-15| the |16-16| Bundesrechnungshof |17-17| organized |18-20| similarly |21-21| , it |22-23| also has |24-26| a board |27-28| constituted |29-29| a little |30-31| differently |32-32| , |33-33| but |34-34| these |35-35| two institutions |36-37| are |38-38| basically |39-39| in a similar way |40-42| . |43-43| 
 the skills |0-1| are also |2-3| , |4-4| to some extent |5-8| , |9-9| similar , |10-11| with |12-12| a nuance |13-14| however |15-15| compared |16-17| to |18-18| our system |19-20| : |21-21| Germany |22-23| is a |24-25| federal structure |26-27| , |28-28| it has |29-30| therefore also |31-32| of |33-33| course |34-34| such |37-39| accounts |35-36| at the level |40-41| of the Länder |42-44| . |45-45| 
 the |0-0| Bank |1-1| can only |2-3| control |4-4| federal |7-7| money |5-6| , |8-8| which is |9-11| home |12-13| to the resources |14-15| of |16-16| the state . |17-19| 
 the |0-0| public funds |1-2| managed |3-3| at home |4-5| by |6-6| the regions |7-8| and |9-9| municipalities |10-11| , |12-12| are |13-13| there |14-16| controlled |17-17| at the level |18-19| of |20-20| the |21-22| Länder |24-25| accounts |23-23| . |26-26| 
 with regard to |0-3| national legislation |4-6| , |7-7| is it |8-10| easier than |11-13| ours |14-15| ? |16-16| 
 I do not wish to |0-3| make |4-5| general comparison |6-7| without |8-8| concrete |10-10| data |9-9| , |11-11| however , |12-13| in some |14-15| areas , |16-17| Germany |18-19| is |20-20| often referred to |21-22| as |23-23| a model |24-25| , but |26-26| it |27-27| surely cannot |28-31| say |32-32| it to do |33-35| better |36-36| in all areas |37-40| . |41-41| 
 this may |0-2| be due to the fact |3-6| that they |7-8| have |9-9| better |10-11| inspectors |12-12| ? |13-13| 
 no , |0-1| certainly not |2-3| , |4-4| but |5-5| I repeat |6-7| , I |8-9| don &apos;t have data |10-14| for comparison |15-16| . |17-17| 
 however , |0-1| it is also true that |2-6| this country |7-8| that we |9-10| see as |11-12| a model |13-14| is also |15-16| facing |17-18| a series |19-21| of problems |22-23| . |24-24| 
 otherwise they |0-1| would have no |2-4| incentive to |5-6| cooperate with |7-8| our institution |9-10| , |11-11| no ? |12-13| 
 with regard to |0-3| national legislation |4-6| , |7-7| that |8-8| has meant |9-10| for you |11-12| , |13-13| as an institution |14-17| , |18-18| the amendment |19-20| of |21-21| the law |22-23| on |24-24| public procurement , |25-28| its |29-29| effects are |30-32| already |33-35| being felt |36-36| ? |37-37| 
 this amendment |0-1| entered |2-3| into force |4-5| relatively |6-6| recently , |7-8| he |9-9| does not yet have an |10-14| impact on |15-16| our operations |17-18| . |19-21| 
 as |0-0| we |1-2| ex @-@ post |5-6| controls |3-4| , |7-7| there is |8-11| a certain |12-13| delay |14-14| . |15-15| 
 our |0-0| comments |1-1| relate only |2-3| , |4-4| for the time being , |5-8| the process |9-10| of preparation |11-12| of future |13-14| controls - |15-16| we have |17-18| launched a |19-20| new instrument |21-22| of |23-23| risk identification |25-27| &quot; |24-24| mismanagement |28-30| &quot; |31-31| with which |32-33| we have |34-35| scrutinized |36-38| nearly |39-40| 14,000 |41-42| public contracts |43-44| - |45-45| that |46-46| these changes |47-48| will |49-50| , of course |51-52| , |53-54| because |55-56| the thresholds |57-58| were modified |59-61| as well as |62-63| the conditions |64-65| of some |66-67| types of |68-69| tendering |71-74| procedures |70-70| and |75-75| so on |76-78| . |79-79| 
 so |4-4| what |0-3| do you consider |5-6| the adoption |7-8| of |9-9| this law |10-11| rather as |12-13| an advantage |14-15| or |16-16| as an |17-18| extra load |19-21| for |22-22| the administration |23-24| ? |25-25| 
 I |0-0| think that |1-2| this law |3-4| is a step in the |5-9| right direction |10-11| and |12-12| I hope |13-14| that |15-15| the future |16-17| will confirm this |18-19| . |20-20| 
 the problem |0-1| that can |2-3| happen |4-4| is that |5-6| these rules |7-8| are tightened |9-11| and |12-12| that it |13-14| is not |15-17| possible to |18-19| meet them |20-21| . |22-22| 
 already |0-0| under the |1-4| previous regulations , |5-8| the claimant |9-10| ( |11-11| for example |12-13| the |14-14| regional council |15-16| , |17-17| in the case of the |18-21| regional operational programmes |22-24| ) |25-25| compelled |26-26| controlled subjects |27-29| to accept |30-31| that any |32-33| violation of |34-35| the law |36-37| on |38-38| the markets |39-40| means |41-41| a breach of |42-44| budgetary discipline |45-47| . |48-48| 
 is it |0-2| really |3-4| useful to |5-6| make |7-7| the law |8-9| more severe |10-11| in this way |12-14| ? |15-15| 
 no , not |0-2| in this way |3-5| , |6-6| I think |7-8| . |9-9| 
 the system must |0-2| exclude |3-3| those who want to |4-6| attack |7-7| the system |8-9| or |10-10| abuse |11-12| but not |13-14| punish |15-15| those who |16-17| commit |18-19| formal errors |20-21| without |22-22| consequence |23-23| on |24-24| the decision @-@ making process |25-27| . |28-28| 
 such a system |0-2| will |3-3| put |4-4| more |5-7| pressure on |8-9| the administration |10-11| . |12-12| 
 so what is |0-2| the solution |3-4| to get by |5-8| ? |9-9| 
 look at |0-0| where |1-2| we |3-3| are not going |4-6| . |7-7| 
 recently , |0-1| the Prime Minister |2-4| said |5-6| that |7-7| the ODS |8-9| would not |10-12| disturb |13-13| the entrepreneurs |14-15| with |16-16| controls |17-18| of the so @-@ called |19-22| Švarc |24-24| system |23-23| - |25-25| what does |26-29| that mean ? |30-33| 
 the system |0-1| is |3-5| prohibited |6-6| Švarc |2-2| or |7-7| authorized |8-8| ? |9-9| 
 the law |0-1| must |2-2| be |3-4| applied |5-5| in one way or |6-10| another |11-12| , |13-13| so if |14-15| it prohibits |16-17| something |18-19| , even |20-21| the head of government |22-25| cannot |26-27| prevent |28-30| an authority |31-33| to |34-35| inspect |36-36| and |37-38| demand respect for |39-42| the law |43-44| . |45-45| 
 he |0-0| may declare |1-2| : |3-3| &quot; |4-4| we will |5-6| change |7-7| the law |8-9| and |10-10| authorize it |11-12| , &quot; |13-14| but |15-15| he |16-16| could not |17-18| say that |19-20| we are going |21-22| to act |23-23| as if |24-25| nothing had happened |26-29| . |30-30| 
 the law |0-1| on |2-2| the markets |3-4| has |5-6| relatively strict |8-9| rules |7-7| on the |10-11| formalities |12-14| , |15-17| precisely |18-18| in order to |19-20| protect |21-21| the tender |22-25| . |26-26| 
 but |0-0| it is |1-2| also |3-4| tragic |5-5| that a |6-7| bidder be |8-9| removed |10-10| only for |11-12| cause of |13-14| formal |16-16| defects |15-15| . |17-17| 
 the law |0-1| will never be |2-4| perfect , |5-6| but |7-7| its application |8-9| must |10-10| be fair |11-12| and |13-13| it is |14-15| , |16-16| in my opinion |17-19| , |20-20| what is lacking |21-24| here |25-26| . |27-27| 
 the roads |0-1| are |2-2| frozen |5-5| in places |3-4| , |6-6| but |7-7| most |8-9| remain |10-10| passable |11-11| . |12-12| 
 in |0-0| some parts |1-2| of the |3-4| Czech |6-6| Republic |5-5| , |7-7| the roads |8-9| are |10-10| icy |11-11| and |12-12| snowy |14-14| too |13-13| . |15-15| 
 the network |0-1| , however , remains |2-3| largely |4-6| practicable |7-7| , |8-8| in some places |9-11| with |12-12| increased vigilance |13-15| . |16-16| 
 Karlovy Vary region |0-3| 
 in |0-0| the region |1-2| of |3-3| Karlovy Vary |4-5| , roads |6-8| were |9-9| passable |12-12| this morning |10-11| , |13-13| but |14-14| in some places |15-16| frosts |17-17| and |18-19| snow |20-20| . |21-21| 
 temperatures |0-1| dropped |2-3| and |4-4| oscillate |5-5| between |6-6| -5 |7-7| ° C and |8-9| -10 |10-10| ° |11-11| C |12-12| , but |13-13| they should |14-15| slightly |16-16| back in |17-18| the day |19-20| . |21-21| 
 the |0-0| snowfall |1-3| stopped |4-5| in |6-6| the region |7-8| and |9-9| it |10-11| remains |12-12| in |13-13| the plains |14-15| that a |16-17| thin layer |18-19| of snow |20-21| . |22-22| 
 the peaks |0-1| of |2-2| Krušné |6-6| Ore Mountains |3-4| ( |5-5| Mountains |7-7| ) |8-8| , however , are |9-10| covered |11-11| by about |12-13| 30 |14-14| centimetres |15-15| of snow |16-17| . |18-18| 
 according to data |0-3| from the |4-4| regional |6-6| service |5-5| maintenance |7-8| of roads |9-10| because |11-13| of the |14-14| fog , |15-16| visibility was |17-19| reduced |22-22| in some places |20-21| . |23-23| 
 the fast track |0-2| R6 |3-3| and |4-4| national roads |5-7| in the region |8-10| are now |11-12| passable |13-13| without |14-14| difficulty . |15-16| 
 vigilance |0-1| remains to be |2-4| made |5-5| , |6-6| for example |7-8| on |9-9| some |10-10| bridges with |11-12| the coating |13-14| can be |15-16| frozen |17-17| and slippery |18-19| . |20-20| 
 all |0-1| roads |2-3| and |4-4| the |5-7| third category |8-9| , |10-10| including |11-12| mountain |15-16| roads |13-14| , |17-17| are also |18-19| feasible |20-20| . |21-21| 
 there is still |0-2| some |3-4| of their |5-6| sections |7-7| of the remains |8-9| of |10-10| frozen |12-12| snow |11-11| and |13-14| traffic |18-19| @-@ packed |16-17| places |15-15| . |20-20| 
 especially |0-0| in areas |1-4| at high altitude |5-6| , |7-7| drivers must |8-10| strengthen their |11-12| vigilance . |13-14|

 the closure |0-1| of the |2-3| movement |4-4| between |5-5| Telnice |6-6| and |7-7| Knínice |8-8| is due |9-10| to |11-11| tree branches |12-15| that |16-16| were |17-18| bent |19-19| under the weight |20-22| of |23-23| snow |24-25| to |26-28| the pavement |29-30| . |31-31|

 we decided |0-2| to use |3-4| the |5-5| marketing |7-7| potential |6-6| of |8-8| the end |9-10| of the |11-11| Maya calendar |12-13| announced |14-14| on |15-16| December 21 |17-18| at 11 |19-20| p.m. |21-21| 10 |22-22| in the morning |23-24| . |25-25|

 we would also like to |0-2| play |3-3| next year |4-6| in |7-7| the house |8-9| of the |10-11| Czech |13-13| Republic |12-12| in New |14-15| York |16-16| and |17-17| personally , |18-19| once |20-21| in |22-22| place |23-23| in the United States |24-27| , |28-28| I &apos;d like to |29-31| combine |32-32| concerts |33-34| in Washington and |35-38| Chicago |39-39| . |40-40| 
 your |0-0| international projects |1-2| are |3-3| minimal , |4-5| so far |6-7| you have |8-9| played |10-10| for example |11-12| in Madrid |13-14| , |15-15| Brussels , |16-17| London and |18-19| Moscow . |20-21| 
 the |0-0| Tap |1-1| Tap |2-2| is |3-3| nevertheless |4-4| a group |5-7| of people |8-9| with disabilities |10-10| . |11-11| 
 how do you manage |0-3| the organization |4-5| and |6-6| logistics |7-8| of your |9-10| tour |11-11| ? |12-12| 
 this is not |0-3| so terrible |4-5| that |6-6| it looks |7-10| at first glance |11-13| . |14-14| 
 we have |0-1| five members |2-3| in |4-4| electric wheelchair |5-6| whose |7-8| must travel |10-11| gear |9-9| in the hold |12-13| , |14-14| of course |15-15| we |16-16| also |18-18| trimbalons |17-17| lots of |19-20| luggage |21-21| and |22-23| boxes |24-24| of instruments |25-26| .... |27-27| 
 so far |0-1| everything |2-2| has |3-4| more |5-5| or less |6-7| always well |8-9| past , |10-11| CSA |12-12| and |13-13| British Airways |14-15| were |16-16| always |17-17| fully prepared |18-19| for us |20-21| , they |22-23| have |25-25| surprised |26-26| me |24-24| more than once |27-30| . |31-31| 
 even |0-0| in Moscow |1-2| , |3-4| where |5-5| we returned |6-8| recently , |9-10| everything happened |11-14| without |15-15| problems . |16-17| 
 thanks to |0-1| your |2-2| travel |3-3| abroad |4-6| , |7-7| you can |8-9| compare |10-10| how |11-12| these countries |13-14| differ |15-15| in terms |16-19| of |20-20| ease |21-21| of access |22-23| for people |24-26| with reduced mobility |27-29| , |30-31| the attitude |32-33| of |34-34| the public |35-37| towards |38-40| persons with disabilities |41-43| and |44-44| so on |45-47| . |48-48| 
 what |0-0| were |1-2| your experiences |3-4| up to |5-6| now ? |7-8| 
 after |0-0| Madrid , |1-2| Luxembourg , |3-4| London and |5-6| other places |7-9| where everything |10-11| works better |12-13| than |14-15| us , |16-17| we have |18-19| just |20-20| witnessed |21-22| in Moscow |23-24| to |25-26| the east |27-28| all |29-29| is still only |30-33| in |34-34| an initial phase |35-37| . |38-38| 
 in |0-2| Prague |3-3| , Moscow |4-5| is |6-6| still very |7-8| little |9-9| accessible |10-10| to persons |11-12| with disabilities |13-13| ; |14-14| there , |15-18| it is not yet |19-23| know |24-24| that a person |25-27| moves |28-29| only |30-30| by |31-31| electric |33-33| chair |32-32| in the |34-35| center of |36-37| the city |38-39| . |40-40| 
 they |0-0| do not regard |1-3| as |4-5| self @-@ evident |6-7| to give priority |8-11| to a |12-13| person |14-15| in |17-17| a |18-18| wheelchair |16-16| lift . |19-20| 
 fortunately , |0-1| there |2-4| also |5-5| , |6-6| an association |7-8| seeking to |9-11| draw attention to |12-15| the problems |16-17| of disabled people |18-20| is |21-21| being created |22-26| . |27-27| 
 how |0-1| do we |2-4| still |5-5| catch up with the |6-7| more developed countries |8-10| ? |11-11| 
 there are a lot |0-3| of things |4-5| for which |6-7| we are |8-9| still lagging |10-12| ... |13-13| 
 it is |0-1| important to mention |2-4| that |5-5| the improvements |6-7| and |8-8| refinements |9-9| still |11-11| depend on |10-10| the efforts of |12-15| the people involved |16-18| . |19-19| 
 in London |0-1| and |2-2| Madrid , |3-4| it is |5-6| quite |7-9| common for |10-11| people |12-13| with |14-14| a severe |15-16| disability |17-17| move |18-19| alone in |20-21| public spaces |22-24| ; |25-25| they can |26-27| go to the toilet |28-30| , |31-31| at the museum |32-33| , |34-34| anywhere |35-37| ... |38-38| 
 this |0-0| is not |1-5| very common |6-7| there |8-10| that a |11-12| large number |13-14| of |15-15| disabled people |16-17| are actively involved |18-19| in social life |20-23| , |24-24| on |25-25| this point |26-27| , you |28-29| , The |30-31| Tap |32-32| Tap |33-33| , are |34-35| quite |36-36| on the contrary |37-38| to |39-39| the cutting edge |40-43| ! |44-44| 
 the respect |0-1| of the public |2-3| and |4-4| the ease of |5-7| access |8-8| are one thing |9-11| , |12-12| but |13-13| the situation |14-15| really |17-17| begin |16-16| to change |18-19| when we have |20-22| among us |23-24| athletes |25-26| , artists , |27-31| actors , |32-33| politicians |34-35| and |36-37| famous |39-39| lawyers |38-38| . |40-40| 
 for |0-0| the moment |1-2| , |3-3| these are only |4-8| isolated cases |9-10| of people |11-12| who have |13-14| a strong will |15-17| . |18-18| 
 the group |0-1| The |2-2| Tap |3-3| Tap |4-4| is currently |5-6| very popular |7-8| , |9-9| go back |10-12| a few years |13-15| , |16-16| what |17-21| prompted you |22-24| in 1998 |25-26| to |27-27| create |28-28| this group |29-30| ? |31-31| 
 I started work |0-4| as an |5-7| educator |8-8| at |9-9| the institute |10-11| Jedlička |12-12| , where |13-14| I |15-15| found myself |16-18| surrounded by |19-20| a lot of |21-22| young people |23-23| willing to |24-26| invest in |27-28| something |29-30| . |31-31| 
 and |0-0| as I |1-2| myself am |3-6| musician |7-7| ( |8-8| I play |9-10| , |11-11| among other things |12-13| , |14-14| the saxophone |15-16| ) |17-17| , |18-18| with |19-19| a colleague |20-21| , |22-22| we created |23-25| a |26-26| musical |28-28| activity |27-27| . |29-29| 
 and |0-0| then |1-1| , |2-2| over time |3-5| , |6-6| as |7-7| our |9-9| moderator |10-10| Láďa |11-11| Angelovič |12-12| said |8-8| , |13-13| it was |14-15| a little |16-17| lost control |18-20| of |21-21| the situation |22-23| ( laughs |24-25| ) |26-26| . |27-27| 
 the success |0-1| came only |2-5| in recent |6-10| years , |11-12| if I |13-14| am not mistaken |15-18| ? |19-19| 
 it |0-0| is true |1-2| , |3-3| the fact |4-5| of creating |6-7| links with |8-10| known |13-13| singers |11-12| and |14-15| work actively |16-17| to |18-18| the promotion |19-20| of the group |21-22| helped us |23-25| . |26-26| 
 we understood that |0-3| , |4-4| if a |5-6| work |7-7| is not visible |8-11| , |12-12| it is as |13-15| if he |16-17| did not exist |18-20| in |21-21| the background |22-23| . |24-24| 
 thanks to |0-1| European |6-6| Union subsidies |2-5| , |7-7| we can |8-9| , |10-10| in addition |11-12| , |13-13| enable us |14-15| to have |16-18| quality |20-21| teachers |19-19| , equipment |22-24| , |25-25| and |26-26| so on |27-29| . |30-30| 
 had you |0-2| aim |3-4| to reach |5-6| such a |7-8| level |9-9| with |10-10| The |11-11| Tap |12-12| Tap |13-13| ? |14-14| 
 from the beginning |0-2| , |3-3| I felt |4-6| that there was |7-10| a |11-11| potential for |12-13| change things |14-16| . |17-17| 
 the |0-0| show business |1-2| is full |3-4| of tips |5-6| that |7-8| copy |9-9| each other |10-13| . |14-14| 
 in a way , |0-4| it is |5-6| logical : |7-8| everything |9-12| new |13-13| is accepted |14-15| with caution |16-17| and it |18-19| lasts |20-20| a long time |21-21| . |22-22| 
 rare |0-0| are the |1-2| original projects |3-4| , |5-5| and |6-6| I dare |7-8| say that |9-10| Tap |11-11| Tap |12-12| is one |13-15| of them |16-18| . |19-19| 
 the first |0-1| impression |2-2| of a |3-4| person who |5-6| sees us |7-8| for the |9-10| first time |11-12| , of course , is |13-14| the |15-15| pity |16-16| , |17-17| it |18-18| is natural |19-20| ... |21-21| 
 but |0-0| the |1-1| pity |2-2| is |3-3| completely unnecessary |4-5| , |6-6| because people |7-10| with |11-11| disabilities |12-13| are not |14-16| in |17-18| pain |19-19| , abandoned |20-21| by all , |22-24| that |25-25| we must |26-27| take pity |28-30| . |31-31| 
 these are people who |0-4| can live |5-6| a |7-7| full |9-11| life |8-8| and |12-12| flourish |13-14| , provided |15-17| they have |18-20| the |21-21| necessary means |22-23| , of course |24-25| . |26-26| 
 I often say that |0-3| when people |4-6| with |7-7| disabilities |8-9| are able to |10-11| achieve |12-12| something |13-14| , |15-15| it is not only |16-20| a step forward |21-22| for them |23-24| , but |25-25| for |26-26| the whole of society |27-29| . |30-30| 
 has your |0-4| success |5-5| is |6-8| also |9-9| due to the fact that |10-13| you are a |14-16| demanding |18-18| leader |17-17| , |19-19| as |20-20| you are |21-22| qualified |23-23| by |24-24| many people |25-27| ? |28-28| 
 if |0-0| we want to |1-2| make the |3-4| quality work |5-7| , |8-8| we must |9-10| be |11-11| uncompromising |12-12| in many areas |13-16| and |17-17| require |18-18| some discipline |19-21| . |22-22| 
 but I |0-1| think |2-3| it is |4-5| quite normal |6-9| . |10-10| 
 some people |0-1| come to us |2-4| with |5-5| a |6-6| romantic vision |7-8| and |9-9| head |10-11| in |12-12| the clouds |13-14| , and when |15-17| they realize |18-21| that they |22-23| must come |24-25| to |26-26| rehearsals |27-27| twice a |28-30| week , |31-32| follow the |33-34| preparatory |36-36| courses |35-35| and |37-37| spend |38-38| a lot of time |39-41| on the road |42-44| for |45-45| the concerts |46-47| , they |48-49| quickly lose |50-51| their enthusiasm |52-53| . |54-54| 
 but |0-0| it works the |1-4| same way |5-6| in each |7-8| group that |9-10| wants to work |11-12| and |13-13| achieve goals |14-16| . |17-17| 
 the group |0-1| The |2-2| Tap |3-3| Tap |4-4| currently has |5-6| 20 members |7-8| . |9-9| 
 how many of them |0-4| were |5-5| already there |6-7| in 1998 |8-9| ? |10-10|

 the aim |0-1| of the |2-2| concert is |3-4| to collect |5-7| money |8-9| ( |10-10| $ |11-13| 25 |14-14| million |15-15| CZK |16-16| ) |17-17| to equip |18-19| the |20-20| multifunctional |24-24| Studeo |25-25| training centre |21-23| which |26-26| is located |27-28| in Prague |29-30| in |31-31| the institute |32-33| Jedlička |34-34| . |35-35|

 Poland |0-1| and |2-2| the cosmos |3-4| . |5-5| 
 last week |0-2| , |3-3| at the meeting |4-7| of ministers |8-9| of the countries |10-11| of the |12-13| European |16-16| Space Agency |14-15| , |17-17| Poland |18-19| was admitted |20-22| as the |23-23| 20th |24-24| member of |25-26| this agency |27-28| , |29-29| it |30-30| is |31-32| the second |33-34| Member State |35-36| of |37-37| the former |38-39| Eastern bloc |40-43| ( |44-44| the |45-45| Czech |47-47| Republic |46-46| became |48-49| a full member |50-53| on November 12 , |54-56| 2008 |57-57| ) |58-58| . |59-59| 
 Poland had |0-2| begun a |3-4| close collaboration |5-6| with ESA |7-9| in 1994 |10-11| and |12-12| in the years |13-16| that followed |17-19| has |20-20| participated in |21-22| a |23-23| number |24-24| of projects |25-26| of |27-27| the agency |28-29| . |30-30| 
 the road |0-1| from Poland |2-4| to space |5-7| , however , began |8-10| much earlier |11-13| . |14-14| 
 even before |0-1| the second |2-3| world war |4-5| , |6-6| Poles |7-8| who |9-9| worked |10-10| on |11-11| space flights |12-14| ; |15-15| they do |16-17| not always |19-20| meet |18-18| understanding . |21-23| 
 for example |3-4| , I |0-0| would like to mention |1-2| the conference |5-6| of |7-7| A. |8-8| Šternfeld |9-9| the |10-11| astronomical observatory |12-13| in Warsaw on 6 |14-18| December |19-19| 1933 |20-20| , |21-21| during which |22-25| he presented |26-27| ideas |28-29| from |30-31| his |32-32| avant @-@ garde |34-37| book |33-33| entitled &quot; |38-39| Introduction |40-40| to |41-41| astronautics |42-43| . &quot; |44-45| 
the developments |0-1| of this |2-3| young engineer |4-5| ( |6-6| born in |7-8| 1905 |9-9| ) |10-10| left |11-11| listeners |12-13| cold |14-14| and years |15-17| later |18-19| Šternfeld |20-20| recalled |21-22| that only |23-24| Dr. |25-26| Jan |27-27| Gadomski |28-28| became interested in |29-31| its work |32-33| . |34-34| 
 in 1934 |0-1| , |2-2| Šternfeld |3-3| won |4-4| in France |5-6| the Robert |7-9| Esnault @-@ Pelterie |10-12| and |13-13| André |14-14| Louis |15-15| Hirsch |16-16| for |17-17| his book |18-19| &quot; |20-20| Introduction |21-21| to |22-22| astronautics |23-24| . &quot; |25-26| 
 the |0-0| doctor |1-1| Jan |2-2| Gadomski |3-3| ( |4-4| 1899 |5-5| @-@ |6-6| 1966 |7-7| ) |8-8| became |9-12| a big |13-14| propagator |15-15| of |16-16| astronomy |17-18| and |19-20| astronautics |21-22| . |23-23| 
 he published |0-1| hundreds |2-3| of articles |4-5| in |6-6| Polish |9-9| newspapers |7-8| and |10-10| wrote |11-11| many |12-13| books |14-14| on |15-16| this |17-17| scientific discipline |18-19| . |20-20| 
 Gadomski |0-0| became |1-2| a |3-3| propagator |4-4| of |5-5| world @-@ renowned |8-10| astronautics |6-7| , |11-11| his contribution |12-13| was |14-15| notably |16-16| rewarded |17-17| by the |18-19| fact that |20-21| his name |22-23| was |24-25| given |26-26| to |27-27| one of the |28-30| craters on |31-32| the |33-33| dark side |34-35| of |36-36| the Moon |37-38| . |39-39| 
 as early as |0-0| 1925 |1-1| was built |2-3| in Poland |4-5| a |6-6| speeder |7-7| intended to |8-9| be |10-10| equipped with |11-12| a |13-13| rocket |15-15| engine |14-14| . |16-16| 
 unfortunately , |3-3| there is |0-2| neither |4-4| the author |5-6| nor |7-7| the details |8-9| of |10-10| this project |11-12| . |13-13| 
 it is not |0-3| clear whether |4-7| the rocket |8-9| was to |10-10| be used to |11-12| propel |13-13| or |14-14| curb the |15-16| speeder |17-17| . |18-18| 
 the only |0-1| information known |2-3| about this |4-5| speeder |6-6| are those |7-8| of |9-9| the press |10-11| at the time . |12-15| 
 from |0-2| 1933 |3-3| , |4-4| Polish |7-7| artillery |5-6| began to |8-9| devote himself |10-11| to the |12-12| rockets |13-13| . |14-14| 
 the |0-0| research was |1-2| conducted by |3-4| the institute |5-6| Komórka |7-7| en Automobielbedrijf Tromp |8-8| Uzbrojenia |9-9| in collaboration |10-11| with teachers |12-14| Mieczyslaw |15-15| Wolfke |16-16| and |17-17| Gustaw |18-18| Mokrzyckiego |19-19| . |20-20| 
 from the documents |0-3| kept |4-4| that |5-5| this research |6-7| had reached |8-9| the |10-10| stage |11-11| of testing |12-13| . |14-14| 
 of course |0-1| , |2-2| with |3-3| the arrival of the |4-6| German armies |7-8| , research |9-11| has |12-13| interrupted |14-14| . |15-15| 
 in 1937 |0-1| , |2-2| the plans |3-4| of a |5-6| photoelectric |10-10| hunting |8-9| rocket |7-7| , |11-11| designed by |12-13| the engineer |14-15| Rohoziński |16-16| , appeared |17-18| in |19-19| the press |20-22| and |23-23| the following year |24-26| was published |27-28| the book |29-30| &quot; |31-31| Rakieta |32-32| - |33-33| Torpeda |34-34| powietrzna |35-35| i |36-36| rakietobomba |37-37| Lotnicza |38-38| &quot; |39-39| of an |40-41| author |42-42| named |43-43| Leliwy |44-44| @-@ |45-45| Krzywoblocki |46-46| . |47-47| 
 these two |0-1| projects were directed |2-5| a |6-6| military use |7-8| of |9-9| rocket |11-12| engines |10-10| . |13-13| 
 just before |0-1| the war |2-3| , |4-4| all |5-6| plans to use |7-10| the technique |11-12| of |13-13| rockets |14-14| were |15-15| carried out |16-16| by the |17-18| Scientific Advisory |20-21| Committee |19-19| ( |22-23| &quot; |24-24| TYMCZASOWEGO |25-25| Komitet |26-26| Doradczo |27-27| @-@ |28-28| Naukowy |29-29| &quot; ) |30-31| , |32-32| who coordinated |33-34| all |35-36| work |37-37| . |38-38| 
 the committee |0-1| was |2-3| established in |4-5| 1937 |6-6| , |7-7| but |8-8| after |9-9| two years |10-11| of operation |12-13| , the |14-15| beginning of |16-17| the war |18-19| ended its activities |20-24| . |25-25| 
 after |0-0| the war |1-2| , |3-3| other |4-5| work on |6-8| aircraft |9-10| were published |11-12| in |13-13| the |14-14| Polish press |15-16| , |17-17| thanks to |18-19| the |20-20| Polish |23-23| Astronautical |22-22| Society |21-21| ( |24-24| Polskie |25-25| Towarzystwo |26-26| Astronautyczne |27-27| ) |28-28| . |29-29| 
 for the |0-1| first time |2-3| , |4-4| there is a |5-6| question |7-7| of a company |8-10| in the |11-12| November issue |13-15| of the |17-17| journal |18-18| Problem |19-19| , 1954 |16-16| , |20-20| in which |21-24| four |25-25| more detailed |27-28| articles |26-26| on |29-30| aeronautics |31-32| . |33-33| 
 in |0-0| one |1-2| of these |3-4| articles , |5-6| written by |7-8| Professor |9-10| M. |11-11| Subotowicze |12-12| , |13-13| it is |14-15| proposed to |16-17| create |18-18| a society |19-20| devoted to |21-22| astronautics |23-24| 
 at that time |0-2| , projects |3-5| of |6-6| artificial satellites |7-8| had already |9-10| been launched |11-12| and |13-13| it |14-14| was clear |15-16| that |17-17| the field |18-19| of |20-20| space research |21-23| was |24-24| in |25-25| the future |26-27| . |28-28| 
 at the beginning |0-1| of |2-2| the year |3-4| 1956 |5-5| , |6-6| the |7-7| Polish |10-10| Astronautical |9-9| Society |8-8| ( |11-11| PTA |12-12| ) |13-13| deployed |14-14| efforts to |15-17| enter |18-19| the |20-20| International Astronautical |22-23| Federation |21-21| ( |24-24| established in |25-26| 1951 |27-27| ) |28-28| and |29-29| in the fall |30-32| , |33-33| the PTA |34-35| became |36-37| a |38-38| regular member |39-40| . |41-41| 
 the following year |0-2| , the |3-4| first president |5-6| of |7-7| the PTA |8-9| , |10-10| Kazimierz |11-11| Zarankiewicz |12-12| ( |13-13| 1902 |14-14| - |15-15| 1959 |16-16| ) |17-17| , became |18-19| vice |20-20| @-@ |21-21| president of |22-23| the |24-24| International Astronautical |26-27| Federation |25-25| . |28-28| 
 he retained |0-1| his |2-2| office until |3-5| his death |6-7| in 1959 |8-9| . |10-10| 
 since 1956 |0-3| , the ATP |4-6| brought |7-7| a significant contribution to the |8-11| successful |13-15| development |12-12| of the |16-17| meteorological |19-19| rocket |18-18| RM ( |20-21| Rakieta |22-22| Meteorologiczna |23-23| ) |24-24| , |25-25| who |26-26| became |27-27| the first |28-29| Polish |31-31| rocket |30-30| to |32-32| carry out scientific research |33-36| . |37-37| 
 the first model |0-2| , RM |3-4| @-@ 1 |5-6| , was |7-8| completed |9-9| in 1957 |10-11| and |12-12| the first |13-14| launch |15-15| took place |16-17| on 10 |18-19| October |20-20| 1958 . |21-22| 
 this |0-0| rocket |1-1| with a range of |2-5| 1,800 |6-6| metres |7-7| had |8-8| 80 |12-12| cm |13-13| in length |9-11| and weighed |14-15| a little |16-17| less than |18-19| 5 |20-20| kg |21-21| . |22-22| 
 subsequently |0-2| was built |3-4| an improved version |5-7| , RM |8-9| @-@ |10-10| 1A and |11-12| , |13-13| during |14-14| the summer of |15-16| 1959 |17-17| , |18-18| flight tests |19-22| of the |23-24| two @-@ stage |26-28| rocket |25-25| RM @-@ |29-30| 2 |31-31| were |32-32| launched |33-33| in |34-34| the desert |35-36| of |37-37| Bledov |38-38| . |39-39| 
 the |0-0| rocket |1-1| had |2-2| a |3-3| 1.4 |6-6| @-@ metre |7-7| long |4-5| and weighed |8-9| probably |10-10| 11.5 |11-11| kg |12-12| . |13-13| 
 the prototype |0-1| after |2-2| should have been |3-5| able to |6-7| make |8-9| concrete |12-12| scientific work |10-11| - |13-13| the rocket |14-15| RM @-@ |16-17| 34 |18-18| ought to have |19-21| a range of up to |22-26| 14.5 |27-27| km |28-28| and |29-29| be used to |30-31| observe |32-32| the wind |33-34| aloft |35-36| . |37-37| 
 but |0-0| in 1963 |1-2| , |3-3| all |4-5| development work |6-8| was |9-9| stopped |10-10| . |11-11| 
 the |0-0| Meteor |2-2| @-@ 1 |3-4| rocket |1-1| development |5-7| during |8-10| the period |11-12| 1962 |13-13| @-@ |14-14| 1965 |15-15| , |16-16| succeeded the |17-18| first |19-19| MR |23-23| @-@ type |21-22| rockets |20-20| . |24-24| 
 this |0-0| rocket |1-1| , |2-2| designed |3-3| with |4-4| two |5-5| floors |6-6| , |7-7| had |8-8| a total |9-11| of |12-12| 510 |13-13| cm |14-14| and |15-15| an |16-16| initial |18-18| weight |17-17| of |19-19| 32.5 |20-20| kg |21-21| . |22-22| 
 three models |0-1| ( |2-2| called |3-3| Meteor |4-4| @-@ |5-5| 1A |6-6| , -1B |7-8| and |9-9| -1C |10-10| ) |11-11| were developed |12-13| ; |14-14| they |15-15| were distinguished |16-17| by |18-18| the dimensions |19-20| of |21-21| the space |22-23| reserved for |24-25| scientific tools |26-27| . |28-28| 
 the |0-0| Meteor |2-2| @-@ |3-3| 1A |4-4| rocket |1-1| had |5-6| a space |7-8| with |9-9| a volume |10-11| of |12-12| 0.4 |13-13| per litre |14-14| , |15-15| whereas |16-17| in |18-18| Meteor |19-19| @-@ |20-20| 1B |21-21| this volume |22-23| was $ |24-25| 0.34 |26-26| per litre |27-27| and |28-29| Meteor |30-30| @-@ 1C |31-32| 0.62 |33-34| per litre |35-35| . |36-36| 
 the maximum range |0-2| of |3-3| all these |4-5| types |6-6| of gear |7-8| was 37 |9-11| km |12-12| . |13-13| 
 in |0-0| the period |1-2| 1965 |3-3| @-@ |4-4| 1968 |5-5| , |6-6| the |7-7| Meteor |9-9| @-@ 2 |10-11| rockets |8-8| were |12-12| developed |13-15| in |16-16| the |17-17| aeronautical |19-19| institute |18-18| , |20-20| the first |21-22| flight |24-25| trials |23-23| began |26-26| in October |27-28| 1970 |29-29| . |30-30| 
 the |0-0| Meteor |2-2| @-@ 2 |3-4| rocket |1-1| had |5-5| an |6-6| initial |8-8| weight |7-7| of |9-9| 380 |10-10| kg |11-11| and |12-12| was capable |13-14| of carrying |15-16| a payload |17-19| of |20-20| 10 |21-21| kg |22-22| at an altitude |23-25| of about |26-27| 60 |28-28| km |29-29| . |30-30| 
 later |0-2| versions |5-6| were built |3-4| Meteor |7-7| @-@ |8-8| 2H |9-9| and |10-10| Meteor |11-11| @-@ |12-12| 3 |13-13| . |14-14| 
 it should also be mentioned |0-4| the entry |5-6| of |7-7| Poland |8-9| at the |10-10| Committee for |13-14| Space |15-15| Research |16-16| ( COSPAR |11-12| ) |17-17| in 1960 |18-19| and |20-20| the creation |21-22| of a |23-24| national committee |25-26| COSPAR |27-27| two |28-28| years later |29-31| . |32-32| 
 under the programme |0-4| Interkosmos |5-5| , |6-6| Poland |7-8| also participated in |9-12| space exploration |13-15| on the |16-17| artificial |20-20| Soviet satellites |18-19| and |21-21| , |22-22| in 1978 |23-24| , |25-25| the pilot |26-27| Miroslaw |28-28| Hermaszewski |29-29| became |30-30| , |31-31| after |32-32| Vladimír |33-33| Remek |34-34| , the |35-36| second |37-37| non |39-39| @-@ Soviet |40-41| cosmonaut |38-38| program . |42-45| 
 the repeal |0-1| of |2-2| the law |3-4| on the |5-6| public work |7-10| is not |11-13| a solution |14-15| . |16-16| 
 last week |0-2| , |3-3| the Constitutional Court |4-6| has |7-7| repealed |8-8| the law |9-10| on |11-11| the work |12-13| of public utility |14-16| . |17-17| 
 this decision |0-1| has raised |2-3| in |4-4| public opinion |5-7| a lively discussion |8-10| . |11-11| 
 undoubtedly |2-4| , it is |0-1| interesting to |5-6| consider |7-7| this issue |8-9| from a |10-11| broader perspective |12-16| . |17-17| 
 the economic systems |0-2| geared towards |3-4| liberalism |5-6| , |7-7| both in the EU and |8-12| in |13-13| the context |14-15| of |16-16| globalization |17-18| , |19-19| are based |20-21| on |22-22| the principle |23-24| of |25-25| more |26-27| economic competition |28-29| unregulated |30-31| . |32-32| 
 this |0-0| means |1-2| that |3-3| the different |4-5| economic entities |6-7| , as well as |8-9| the |10-10| national economic |12-13| systems |11-11| are |14-14| perpetually |15-15| in conflict |16-17| with each other |18-22| . |23-23| 
 this is the result |0-1| of the principle |2-3| of |4-4| freedom |5-6| of trade and |7-10| the |11-11| free |13-13| circulation |12-12| ( |14-14| without |15-15| limitation |16-16| ) |17-17| of private capital |18-20| combined with |21-22| rampant |26-26| financial speculation |23-25| . |27-27| 
 the |0-0| huge differences |1-2| in the price |3-4| of labour |5-6| ( wages |7-8| ) |9-9| generate tension |10-12| on prices |13-15| . |16-16| 
 it should be |0-2| put |3-3| under |4-4| this term |5-6| the |7-7| following meaning |8-9| : |10-10| a producer |11-12| tries |13-14| by |15-15| the importation |16-17| of goods |18-19| sold |20-20| cheaply |21-23| to withstand |24-26| economic competition |27-29| by |30-30| making it more |32-33| expensive |34-34| &quot; |31-31| &quot; the |35-36| competitor &apos;s |38-39| price |37-37| , |40-40| in order |41-43| to remove |44-45| a larger share |46-49| of the market |50-51| and |52-52| thereby increase |53-55| its own |56-57| profits . |58-59| 
 on a large scale , |0-3| this means |4-5| for |6-6| most entrepreneurs |7-10| : either |11-12| transferring |13-13| production |14-15| abroad |16-18| , or |19-20| buy |21-21| at low prices |22-24| , or |25-26| disappear . |27-28| the result |29-30| is |31-31| high unemployment |32-34| in countries where |35-38| labour |41-42| prices |39-40| are high |43-44| compared |45-46| to |47-47| other |48-49| economies . |50-51| 
 given |0-1| that the |2-3| private |5-5| capital |4-4| has no |6-8| social |10-14| responsibility |9-9| and thereby |15-19| responsibility |20-20| vis @-@ à @-@ vis |21-23| unemployment |24-25| that it |26-27| generates |28-28| , |29-29| the |30-30| social costs |31-32| of |33-33| the State |34-35| necessarily increase |36-37| . |38-38| 
 this whole |0-1| situation |2-2| intensifies |3-3| the perfect |4-5| unwillingness |6-7| of |8-8| gentlemen |9-9| contractors |10-11| to |12-12| pay taxes |13-15| and |16-16| to |17-17| compensate for |18-19| the |20-20| economic |22-22| and social |23-24| damage |21-21| caused to |25-26| the whole |27-28| of society |29-31| in |32-32| this |33-33| race for profit |34-36| . |37-37| 
 this situation |0-1| is |2-2| so |3-6| well known |7-9| that it |10-11| is not necessary |12-15| to provide |16-17| concrete |21-21| statistical data |18-20| . |22-22| 
 the |0-0| unscrupulous |2-3| practices |1-1| of private capital |4-6| in individual economies |8-11| create |7-7| a situation |12-13| in which |14-15| the governments |16-17| of |18-18| various countries |19-20| are forced |21-22| to |23-23| engage in |24-26| mutual |29-29| competition |27-28| in order to |30-31| artificially lower |32-33| the |34-34| social level |35-36| of their |37-38| own people |39-40| in |41-41| order to |42-44| attract |45-47| the |48-48| foreign capital |49-50| . |51-51| 
 in other words |0-1| , governments |2-4| are putting their |5-6| own people |7-8| at the mercy |9-11| of private capital |12-14| without taking |15-16| into account |17-18| the |19-19| social collapse |20-21| . |22-22| 
 this |0-0| occurs |1-2| mainly in |3-4| the amendments |5-6| of existing laws |7-10| . |11-11| 
 the goal |0-1| is |2-2| to compel |3-4| economically |5-5| his |6-6| own people |7-8| to accept |9-10| the |11-11| dictates of the |12-13| price of |14-15| private |17-17| capital |16-16| , |18-18| particularly in |19-20| the area |21-22| of wages |23-24| . |25-25| 
 this happens |0-2| on the one hand |3-5| by |6-6| a system |7-8| of |9-9| economic constraints |10-11| in the event |12-13| of |14-14| long @-@ term |16-18| unemployment |15-15| and |19-23| the restriction of the rights |24-27| of workers |28-29| in |30-30| the field |31-32| of |33-33| labour |36-37| legislation |34-35| . |38-38| 
 the result is a |0-3| growing poverty |4-5| and |6-6| the deepening |7-8| of differences |9-10| between |11-11| the rich |12-13| and poor . |14-17| 
 in |0-0| Germany , |1-2| there are |3-4| for years |5-7| of |8-8| public distribution |11-12| points |9-10| for food |13-14| for |15-15| the poor |16-17| who cannot meet |18-22| their |23-23| needs |24-24| with |25-25| their own |26-27| work . |28-29| 
 there are |0-1| already |2-2| a |3-3| million |4-4| the number |5-6| of these |7-8| people . |9-10| 
 in |0-0| the context |1-2| of |3-3| increasing |4-6| the competitiveness |7-8| of |9-9| the German economy |10-12| , |13-13| it is |14-15| quite |16-18| common for |19-20| employees |21-22| receive |23-23| such |24-25| salaries |26-26| that |27-27| the State |28-29| is obliged to |30-33| pay a premium |34-36| to |37-39| reach the |40-41| minimum subsistence level |42-43| . |44-44| 
 such a |0-1| scandal |2-2| , for example , has |3-5| been |6-6| updated |7-9| in |10-10| the case |11-12| of employees working |13-15| as |16-16| auxiliaries |17-17| to the |18-18| federal parliament |19-20| . |21-21| 
 the cost @-@ saving measures |0-3| of |4-4| virtually |5-5| all |6-7| member states |8-9| of the |10-10| EU |13-14| &apos;s southern |11-12| generate |15-15| , |16-16| undoubtedly |17-19| , |20-20| a |21-21| similar situation |22-23| in which |24-25| , |26-26| under the pressure |27-29| of a |30-31| catastrophic |33-33| collapse |32-32| of society |34-36| , people |37-39| are forced |40-41| to emigrate |42-44| ( |45-45| as was the case |46-50| in the 19th |51-52| century |53-53| ) or |54-56| to languish |57-58| with |59-59| poverty wages |60-63| , |64-64| on the margins |65-66| of society |67-69| , |70-70| in |71-71| the hope |72-73| that one day |74-76| the |77-77| private |79-79| capital |78-78| to invest in |80-81| their country |82-83| . |84-84| 
 here |2-2| we must |0-1| ask |3-4| the question : |5-8| where will |9-11| this capital |12-13| ? |14-14| 
 if it |0-1| comes from |2-3| other EU countries |4-8| , then |9-10| poverty |11-12| will rise |13-13| from one country to |14-17| another |18-19| ; |20-20| this capital |21-22| may not |23-25| come |26-26| , |27-29| or |30-31| a |32-32| Chinese , |33-34| an Indian |35-36| , |37-37| a Brazilian |38-39| , |40-40| a Turk |41-42| , |43-43| a Moroccan |44-45| , |46-46| an Egyptian |47-48| or |49-49| African |50-50| will continue |51-51| to work |52-53| for |54-54| a fraction |55-56| of a |57-58| European |60-60| wage |59-59| . |61-61| 
 this |0-0| also applies to |1-2| all of Latin America |3-6| . |7-7| 
 the |0-0| liberal theory |1-2| and |3-3| the media |4-5| say |6-6| , |7-7| to |8-8| have enough of it |9-11| , |12-12| that |13-13| the State |14-15| cannot |16-18| make |19-20| capital investments |21-23| in its |24-25| own economy |26-27| , |28-28| that the |29-30| command economy |31-32| led to |33-34| an |35-35| economic disaster |36-37| . |38-38| 
 the |0-0| private |2-2| capital |1-1| vigorously |4-4| defends |3-3| the idea |5-6| that |7-7| the state |8-9| cannot |10-12| intervene in |13-14| the economy |15-16| by |17-17| regulatory |20-20| interventions |18-19| . |21-21| 
 the question then becomes |0-4| whether the |5-6| private |8-8| capital |7-7| does not influence |9-11| and |12-12| , even |13-14| , |15-15| does not run |16-18| today |19-20| , |21-21| according to |22-22| its own |23-24| selfish interests |25-26| , politics |27-29| and |30-30| by |31-31| the same |32-33| , |34-34| the |35-35| entire |37-38| state |36-36| . |39-39| 
 the answer |0-1| to this question is |2-5| certainly |6-8| yes |9-9| . |10-10| 
 the proof is |0-3| that there is a |4-7| virtually |9-9| all |10-10| @-@ powerful |11-12| lobby |8-8| and |13-13| present |14-14| in |15-15| all |16-17| states . |18-19| 
 the result is a |0-3| desperate situation |4-5| occurring |6-7| in |8-8| the field |9-10| of |11-11| corruption |12-13| , |14-14| by |15-15| the granting |16-17| of |18-18| mutual benefits |19-20| in |21-22| the legislation |23-24| , |25-25| where everything |26-27| is wrong |28-29| but not |30-31| punishable |32-32| . |33-33| 
 in |0-0| Germany , |1-2| the situation |3-4| is such |5-6| that , |7-8| because |9-10| of the |11-11| lack of |12-13| financial resources |14-15| , |16-16| the national ministries |17-19| delegate |20-20| the preparation of draft |21-25| laws |26-26| to |27-27| law firms |28-31| closely linked |32-33| to |34-34| the industry |35-36| . |37-37| 
 these |0-0| bills |1-3| are then |4-5| adopted |6-6| in the Bundestag |7-8| . |9-9| 
 the entire |0-2| power |3-3| does not come from the |4-7| people , |8-9| as |10-10| the |11-13| Western @-@ style |15-17| constitutions |14-14| but |18-19| powerful |20-21| financial groups |22-23| serving |24-24| their |25-25| own interests |26-27| . |28-28| 
 it is |0-1| clear that |2-3| the |8-8| free market |9-9| @-@ oriented |6-7| democracies |4-5| are |10-11| now |12-12| quickly |13-13| confronted with |14-15| the situation |16-17| described by |18-19| Appianos |20-20| in |21-21| his book |22-23| entitled &quot; |24-25| the crisis |26-27| of |28-28| the |29-30| Roman Empire |31-32| at the |33-33| time |34-34| of |35-35| Caesar |36-36| and |37-38| Pompey |39-39| &quot; |40-40| : |41-41| &quot; |42-42| the |43-44| State |45-45| had long been |46-48| deteriorating |49-51| and functions |52-54| were |55-55| assigned |56-56| by |57-57| violence |58-59| . |60-60| 
 the blows |0-1| of |2-2| bribes |3-7| , |8-8| favors received |9-11| illegally |12-12| , |13-13| and |14-14| the stones |15-16| and |17-17| swords |18-19| were also |20-21| used to |22-23| obtain |24-24| these positions |25-26| . |27-27| 
 the |0-0| kickbacks |1-5| and |6-6| corruption |7-8| were spreading without |9-10| limits and |11-12| the people |13-14| went |15-16| to the |17-17| election with |18-19| the votes |20-21| already |22-22| sold |23-23| ... &quot; |24-25| ... |26-26| &quot; |27-27| The |28-28| honest |30-30| people |29-29| did |31-32| not |34-34| seek |33-33| to |35-35| obtain |36-37| functions , |38-39| the result was |40-42| once |43-45| the State |46-47| was |48-48| 8 |49-49| months |50-50| without |51-51| consuls |52-52| .... &quot; |53-54| &apos; |55-55| It |56-56| really |58-58| began |57-57| to |59-59| say that |60-61| the cure for |62-64| this |65-65| difficult situation |66-67| was |68-68| an autocracy |69-70| and |71-71| that he |72-73| had to |74-74| choose |75-75| an |76-76| energetic man |77-78| ... &quot; |79-80| It is |81-82| true that |83-84| Pompey |90-90| Appianos |85-85| had |86-86| in mind |87-89| , |91-91| but |92-92| it is |93-94| Caesar |95-95| who transformed |96-98| irreversibly |99-99| democracy |100-101| in |102-102| absolutist |104-104| regime |103-103| . |105-105| 
 in conclusion |0-1| , |2-2| as in |3-4| antiquity |5-6| , |7-7| the |8-8| current society |9-10| is based |11-12| on |13-13| the preference |14-15| of the |16-16| personal benefit |17-18| , |19-19| without |20-20| regard for |21-22| the interests |23-24| of society |25-27| as a whole |28-30| . |31-31| 
 in essence |0-2| , the |3-4| private |6-6| capital |5-5| is no longer able to |7-11| understand and |12-13| to advance the interests |14-18| of society as |19-22| a whole |23-24| . |25-25| 
 as a result |0-2| , |3-3| today |4-5| as in the past |6-7| , |8-8| an |9-9| unprecedented |11-12| decadence |10-10| of the elites |13-14| , |15-15| without any |16-17| effort to |18-19| conduct |20-21| in @-@ depth |23-24| reforms |22-22| . |25-25| 
 we must |0-1| therefore seek |2-3| the causes |4-5| of |6-6| the emergence |7-8| of |9-9| fascist and communist |11-13| regimes |10-10| in |14-14| unscrupulous |17-18| liberalization |15-16| of economic systems |19-21| of the 19th and 20th |22-25| centuries |26-26| . |27-27| 
 in |0-0| the current state of affairs |1-5| , |6-6| we can |7-8| consider |9-9| the disappearance |10-11| of |12-12| these systems |13-14| for the benefit |15-16| of the |17-17| Liberal |21-21| @-@ type |19-20| democracies |18-18| as a kind |22-24| of |25-25| pause |26-26| before |27-27| a |28-28| new stage |29-30| . |31-31| 
 the fact |0-1| that the |2-3| current |5-5| elites |4-4| completely |7-7| ignore |6-6| the possibility |8-9| of hundreds |10-11| of thousands |12-13| of future |14-15| loss of life |16-19| , |20-20| the |21-21| social and |24-25| humanitarian crises |22-23| that |26-26| we are |27-28| today |29-30| the witnesses |31-32| as well as |33-34| crimes against |35-37| humanity |38-39| as we know them |40-44| by |45-46| recent and |50-51| ancient history |47-49| . |52-52| 
 the repeal |0-1| of |2-2| the law |3-4| on the |5-6| public work |7-10| is not |11-13| a solution |14-15| , at least |16-18| in the long |19-20| term . |21-22| 
 under the pressure |0-2| of economic competition |3-6| , |7-7| both internationally and |8-12| domestically |13-15| , |16-17| the government |18-19| of the |20-21| Czech |23-23| Republic |22-22| will be |24-24| forced to |25-26| continue |27-27| to seek |28-29| ways to |30-32| reduce the |33-34| social level |35-36| of |37-37| the population |38-39| . |40-40| 
 this trend |0-1| is |2-3| systemic |5-5| effect |4-4| . |6-6| 
 the solution |0-1| is |2-3| to |6-6| set out |7-7| socio @-@ political |8-8| reforms |4-5| , which |9-10| will strengthen |11-11| the |12-12| capital investment of |13-16| the state in |17-19| the economy |20-21| , |22-22| will increase |23-23| the influence |24-25| of citizens |26-27| in the |28-29| government , and |30-31| will weaken |32-32| the |33-33| monopoly position |34-36| of private capital |37-39| in society |40-42| for the benefit |43-44| of |45-45| the State |46-47| . |48-48| 
 Israel |0-0| : |1-1| laboratory |2-2| of chaos |3-4| . |5-5| 
 &quot; |0-0| nothing |1-2| will |3-3| ever |4-4| violence |5-7| and |8-8| never |9-9| will |10-11| , &quot; says |12-13| Sting |14-14| in |15-15| the |16-16| song |17-18| Fragile |19-19| whose |20-21| main |23-24| to |22-22| refrain |25-25| is &quot; |26-27| let us not forget |28-30| how |31-31| fragile |34-34| we are |32-33| . &quot; |35-36| 
 &quot; if |0-1| my |2-2| son |3-3| did not want |4-7| war , |8-9| there |10-13| would be no |14-15| , &quot; |16-17| said |18-18| Gutele |19-19| Schnaper |20-20| , |21-21| the |22-22| wife |23-23| of |24-24| Mayer |25-25| Amschel |26-26| Rothschild |27-27| on |28-28| his deathbed |29-32| in 1849 |33-34| . |35-35| 
 following the |0-2| latest wave |3-4| of violence |5-6| between Israel |7-8| and |9-9| the Gaza |10-12| Strip |13-13| , |14-14| as usual , |15-18| many reactions |19-21| were |22-23| high . |24-25| 
 some take |0-2| advantage |3-3| of Israel |4-5| , |6-6| citing |7-8| its right |9-10| to self @-@ defence and |11-14| placing |15-15| the Palestinians |16-17| in |18-18| the role |19-20| of terrorists |21-22| , |23-23| others argue |24-26| the Palestinians |27-28| , citing |29-30| racism |31-32| of |33-33| the State |34-35| of Israel |36-37| , |38-38| the genocide |39-40| committed against |41-42| the Palestinian Arabs |43-46| and |47-47| recognizing |48-48| Israel as |49-50| a |51-51| terrorist state |52-53| . |54-54| 
 I don &apos;t want to |0-3| reflect on |4-5| the question of who |6-10| is guilty |11-12| and |13-13| who |14-14| is the victim |15-16| , |17-17| in his |18-19| recurring |23-23| waves of killing |20-22| ; |24-24| after all |25-26| , |27-27| the current |28-29| inhabitants |30-30| of Israel |31-32| , |33-33| including |34-35| those of the |36-37| autonomous territories |38-39| , |40-40| were born |41-42| in |43-43| the present |44-45| political situation |46-47| and |48-48| did |49-50| not live |51-52| to the start |53-54| of the violence |55-56| . |57-57| 
 I |0-0| would like to |1-1| offer |2-2| readers a |3-5| view |6-8| located |9-9| &quot; |10-10| behind |11-11| the curtain |12-13| , &quot; |14-15| on |16-16| those |17-17| who |18-19| primarily benefit |20-21| persisting |24-25| tensions |22-23| already |26-26| for more than |27-29| 95 |30-30| years |31-31| ( |32-32| from the |33-36| Balfour Declaration |37-38| in 1917 |39-40| ) |41-41| in |42-42| a small |43-44| piece of |45-46| countries in the Middle |47-49| East |50-51| . |52-52| 
 some of |0-1| these ideas |2-3| are based |4-5| on |6-6| historical facts |7-9| available |10-10| to |11-11| the study |12-13| , |14-14| other |15-16| emerged from |17-18| my own |19-20| understanding of |21-22| that |23-23| , |24-24| or , more precisely , |25-27| the group |28-29| of individuals |30-31| , which |32-33| is the main |34-36| instigator |37-37| of the events |38-39| in modern history |40-43| . |44-44| 
 the history |0-1| of |2-2| humanity |3-4| is primarily |5-7| the story of a |8-11| struggle for power |12-15| . |16-16| 
 each |0-1| time , |2-3| we can |4-5| find a |6-7| Alexander the Great |8-10| or |11-12| Napoleon |13-13| . |14-14| 
 what |0-1| is not so |2-5| clear |6-6| is whether |7-10| these |11-11| individuals |12-12| were acting |13-13| independently |14-16| or |17-17| if they |18-19| were to |20-20| their actions |21-22| to the throne |23-24| to |25-25| someone |26-27| who led |28-29| their acts |30-31| according |32-33| to |34-34| pre @-@ |36-36| defined |37-37| objectives |35-35| . |38-38| 
 we must |0-1| admit that |2-3| we live |4-5| in a time when |6-9| the |10-10| world &apos;s wealth |11-12| is concentrated |13-14| in the hands |15-17| of |18-18| a few individuals |19-20| , and |21-21| that this |22-23| financial |25-25| concentration |24-24| causing |26-26| some |27-27| powers |28-28| could not |29-32| be done |33-34| in a |35-38| single generation |39-40| . |41-41| 
 among |0-0| families |1-2| with |3-3| an |4-4| astronomical |6-6| wealth |5-5| from |7-9| the Rothschild family |10-12| , which |13-14| could |15-15| be |16-16| seen as |17-18| the head |19-20| of |21-21| the octopus |22-23| ( |24-24| I do not know |25-26| if |27-27| these families |28-29| still have |30-31| a leader |32-33| , but |34-34| I don |35-36| &apos;t rule out |37-39| ) |40-40| . |41-41| 
 little |0-0| is written |1-2| about them |3-5| . |6-6|

 their |0-0| thirst for |1-2| power at the |3-4| global level |5-6| has led |7-8| in |9-11| 1859 |12-12| in |13-13| 1871 |14-14| in |15-15| the formulation |16-17| of |18-18| a plan |19-20| of three |21-22| world wars |23-24| by |25-25| Albert |26-26| Pike , |27-28| a |29-29| Freemason |30-32| initiated |33-33| at the |34-34| 33rd |35-35| degree |36-36| , being |37-38| the highest level |39-43| . |44-44| 
 the |0-0| first war |1-2| aimed |3-5| to eliminate |6-7| the large |8-9| state |11-11| monarchies |10-10| of |12-12| Europe , |13-14| the second |15-16| was to |17-17| eliminate |18-18| colonialism |19-20| , including |21-22| British , |23-24| and |25-25| the third |26-27| is expected to reduce |28-29| the global population |30-32| between |33-33| 1 and |34-35| 0.5 |36-36| billion people |37-39| ( |40-40| such a |41-42| quantity |43-43| of slaves |44-45| is sufficient |46-47| for their |48-49| luxury and |50-51| comfort ) |52-53| , |54-54| creating |55-55| a single |56-57| universal religion |58-59| ( |60-60| ecumenism |61-62| is |63-64| nothing other than |65-68| the beginning of |69-71| such a solution |72-74| ) |75-75| and |76-76| , |77-77| in the end |78-79| , |80-80| acquire |81-81| an |82-82| absolute power |83-84| . |85-85| 
 the method |0-1| used by |2-3| the clan |4-5| of |6-6| the richest |8-10| families |7-7| headed by |11-14| the |15-15| Rothschild |16-16| is to |17-18| create |19-19| a crisis |20-21| and |22-23| then propose |24-25| a solution |26-27| ( |28-28| order |29-29| ab |30-30| chaos |31-31| - |32-32| the order |33-35| after |36-36| the chaos |37-38| . |39-40| 
 these solutions |0-1| are false |2-3| and |4-4| always lead |5-6| to a |7-8| worsening of |9-10| the situation |11-12| ( see |13-14| the creation |15-16| of the |17-18| EDF |19-19| intended to |20-21| avoid |22-22| that |23-23| are not repeated |24-27| crises |28-29| such as those |30-31| they |32-33| produced |34-34| in 1907 |35-36| ) |37-37| . |38-38|

 for |0-0| an |1-1| easier |3-4| outbreak |2-2| of the |5-6| Second World War |7-9| , |10-10| the bankers |11-12| have left |13-14| politicians |15-16| create |17-17| a situation |18-19| of |20-20| latent conflict |21-22| : |23-23| they have |24-25| , |26-26| on the one hand , |27-30| imposed on |31-32| Germany |33-34| enormous |36-36| war reparations |37-39| for |35-35| creating |40-41| the conditions for a |42-45| radicalization |46-46| of the impoverished masses |47-49| ( |50-50| they |51-52| can then |53-55| place a |56-57| strong |60-60| enough |59-59| leader |58-58| , |61-61| pointing |62-64| blame |65-66| , |67-67| offering |68-69| simple solutions |70-71| ) |72-72| and |73-73| , |74-74| on the other hand , |75-78| they created |79-80| a |81-81| Czechoslovakia |82-82| composed of |83-84| different nationalities |85-86| , |87-87| including |88-89| a strong |90-92| German minority |93-94| who |95-95| had to |96-96| play |97-97| the role |98-99| ( |100-100| she |101-102| was |103-103| actually |104-104| ) |105-106| fifth |107-107| column |108-108| for |109-109| the house |110-114| and |115-115| start a war |116-118| . |119-119| 
 at the end |0-2| of the 19th |3-4| century |5-5| , |6-6| the |7-7| Rothschield |8-8| inspired |9-9| the creation |10-11| of the |12-12| Zionist |14-14| movement |13-13| , |15-15| one of whose |16-19| branches |20-20| aspired |21-21| to |22-22| the creation |23-24| of a |25-26| Jewish state |27-28| , |29-29| preferably |30-31| in |32-32| the region |33-34| of |35-35| Judea |36-37| history |38-38| with |39-39| Jerusalem |40-40| as its capital |41-42| ( |43-43| return to |44-45| Zion |46-46| ) |47-47| . |48-48| 
 the |0-0| Balfour |3-3| Declaration |1-2| mentioned |4-4| above |5-7| laid the |8-9| foundations for |10-11| a |12-12| massive emigration |13-14| of Jews |15-16| to Palestine |17-19| and |20-20| the first |21-22| Arab |28-28| friction with |23-24| the |25-25| local population |26-27| began |29-29| . |30-30| 
 the |0-0| terrorist acts |1-2| were committed |3-4| on both sides |5-9| . |10-10| 
 the second |0-1| world war |2-3| broke out |4-4| ; |5-5| it is |6-7| difficult to |8-9| assess whether |10-11| Hitler |12-12| broke |13-14| the chains |15-16| in which |17-18| international bankers |19-21| had |22-24| initially |25-25| ; |26-26| or |27-27| if |28-28| all he |29-32| did was |33-35| planned , |36-37| but the fact remains that |38-42| the suffering |43-44| of the Jews |45-46| of |47-47| Europe |48-48| in the concentration camps |49-53| created |54-54| the foundation for |55-57| the acceptance |58-59| of a |60-61| Jewish state |62-63| by |64-64| the |65-65| world community |66-67| . |68-68| 
 Israel |0-0| was officially |1-2| founded in |3-4| 1948 |5-5| ; |6-6| in the same way as |7-11| war reparations |12-15| imposed on |16-17| Germany |18-19| were |20-20| at |21-21| the origin |22-23| of the |24-25| Second World War |26-28| , |29-29| the |30-30| founding of |31-32| the State |33-34| of Israel |35-36| has |37-37| lit a |38-39| fire |40-42| that could |43-43| cause a |44-45| third |46-46| world war |47-48| . |49-49| 
 if |0-0| international bankers |1-3| can |4-5| trigger |6-6| this war |7-8| , |9-9| the |10-10| Jewish population |11-12| will be |13-13| as it |14-16| was |17-17| during |18-20| the second |21-22| world war |23-24| , |25-25| the first |26-27| victim |28-28| of the fighting |29-30| , this time |31-33| as well as |34-36| the |37-37| Arab |39-39| or |40-40| Muslim |42-42| population |38-38| generally |41-41| of the |43-43| Middle East |44-45| . |46-46| 
 Israel |0-0| is like |1-2| a huge |3-4| laboratory |5-5| , |6-6| the source |7-8| of discord |9-10| and |11-12| chaos , |13-14| not only |15-16| in |17-17| this country |18-19| but |20-21| at the international level |22-24| ( |25-25| suffice it to |26-28| see how |29-30| people are |31-33| bitterly |35-35| divided |34-34| between |36-36| supporters |37-37| and defenders |38-39| of Israel |40-41| ) |42-42| . |43-43| 
 who |0-0| is guilty |1-2| and |3-3| who |4-4| is the victim |5-6| in the |7-8| Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict |9-12| , where |13-14| a |15-15| wrong |16-16| begets |17-17| another |18-19| wrong |20-20| according to |21-21| a circle |22-23| of violence |24-27| and |28-28| where |29-29| there is |30-31| at |32-33| the origin |34-35| of |36-36| all , |37-38| the greed |39-40| of |41-41| some individuals |42-43| and |44-44| their desire |45-46| to acquire |47-48| the power |49-50| on |51-51| the world |52-54| ? |55-55| 
 here |2-2| we must |0-1| make the difference |3-5| between the |6-7| ordinary citizens |8-9| of Israel |10-11| and |12-12| their leaders |13-14| , |15-15| because |16-17| as |18-18| home , |19-21| international bankers |22-24| do not |25-25| propose |26-26| to people |27-28| in the elections |29-30| that |31-31| their own |32-33| candidates . |34-35| 
 the |0-0| current Prime |1-2| Minister |3-3| of Israel |4-5| is a |6-7| typical example |8-9| of |10-10| fascisant |12-12| politician |11-11| , |13-13| loyal |14-14| vis @-@ à @-@ vis |15-17| international |20-20| bankers |18-19| , |21-21| who |22-22| does everything |23-24| in order to |25-26| start a war |27-29| with Iran |30-32| , which |33-34| could |35-35| , |36-36| because of |37-39| the country &apos;s accession |40-44| to the |45-46| Shanghai Cooperation Organization |47-51| ( China |52-53| , India |54-55| , |56-56| Russia , |57-58| Pakistan , |59-60| etc |61-61| ... |62-62| ) |63-63| spread |64-65| to become |66-67| a |68-68| global conflict |69-70| and |71-71| , |72-72| given |73-74| that Iran |75-77| controls the |78-79| Strait of Hormuz , |80-82| through which |83-84| passes |85-85| 20 |86-86| % |87-87| of |88-88| the |89-90| world &apos;s oil |91-92| ( |93-93| this |94-94| naval |96-96| corridor |95-95| has |97-98| a width |99-100| of only 2 |101-103| miles |104-104| ) |105-105| and |106-106| create |107-107| a |108-108| destruction of |109-110| the global economy |111-113| . |114-114| 
 in what |0-1| light |2-2| now appear |3-4| the remarks made |5-7| by |8-8| David |9-9| Rockefeller |10-10| in 1994 |11-12| : |13-13| &quot; |14-14| the only |15-16| thing we need |17-21| is a |22-23| general crisis |24-25| and |26-26| people |27-28| will accept |29-29| a |30-30| new world order |31-33| . &quot; |34-35| 
 in their |0-1| view |2-2| , the |3-4| new world order |5-7| is |8-8| a world |9-10| of |11-11| masters |12-12| and slaves |13-15| . |16-16| 
 a world |0-1| in which |2-3| a |4-4| handful of |5-6| aristocrats |7-7| finance |8-10| is |11-11| served by |12-13| the rest |14-15| of |16-16| the human population |17-19| . |20-20|

 you have to understand |0-2| : |3-3| that |4-7| of common sense |8-10| in |11-11| the figures |12-13| of this |14-15| ferocious |17-17| beast |16-16| . |18-18| 
 this number |0-1| refers to |2-2| the man |3-4| and |5-5| it is |6-7| six hundred and |8-9| sixty |10-10| six |11-11| . &quot; |12-13|

 in November |0-1| 1979 |2-2| , |3-3| a crowd |4-5| of demonstrators |6-7| composed of |8-9| Islamist |11-11| students |10-10| stormed |12-14| the US embassy in |15-18| Tehran and |19-20| held |21-21| 52 |24-24| diplomats |25-25| hostage |22-23| . |26-26| 
 they were to |0-1| be released |2-3| in exchange for the |4-6| Shah |7-7| Mohammad |8-9| Reza |10-10| Pahlavi |11-11| , |12-12| who |13-13| , |14-14| after |15-15| the revolution |16-17| , |18-18| had |19-19| fled |20-20| to the |21-21| United States |22-24| , which |25-26| supported |27-27| his regime |28-29| for several |30-31| decades |32-32| . |33-33| 
 the situation |0-1| did not offer |2-4| to |5-5| the US administration |6-8| of |9-9| positive outcome |10-11| , |12-12| she could not |13-16| , in |17-18| effect |19-19| , |20-20| abandon |21-21| the |22-22| Shah |23-23| , |24-24| because |25-26| it would have |27-28| severely |29-29| shaken |30-30| the confidence |31-32| of |33-33| its allies |34-35| in other countries |36-39| . |40-40| 
 however , |0-1| in Iran |2-3| , where |4-5| the revolution |6-7| had |8-8| led to |9-10| the establishment |11-12| of a |13-14| theocratic |16-16| regime |15-15| , |17-17| it |18-18| was |19-20| able |21-22| to obtain |23-24| the release of the hostages |25-28| . |29-29| 
 it was a |0-2| blow to |3-5| the prestige |6-7| of the |8-8| United States |9-11| , |12-12| suddenly |13-13| worsened |14-15| later |16-17| by |18-18| the fiasco |19-20| of |21-21| the attempt |22-23| to rescue hostages |24-27| by force |28-30| . |31-31| 
 diplomats |0-1| kidnapped |2-2| were eventually |3-4| released |5-5| 444 |6-6| days later |7-9| , |10-10| following negotiations |11-13| held |14-14| by the |15-16| Algerian government |17-18| . |19-19| 
 their fate |0-1| in the United States |3-6| provoked |2-2| a wave |7-8| of solidarity |9-10| and |11-11| an |12-12| anti |14-14| @-@ Iranian |15-16| sentiment |13-13| . |17-17|

 the film |0-1| of |2-2| Affleck |3-3| is an |4-5| unusual |7-7| combination |6-6| of several |8-9| types |10-10| . |11-11| 
 it is a |0-4| part |5-5| of a |6-7| political |9-9| thriller |8-8| designed |10-12| realistic |13-13| but also |14-15| a |16-16| &quot; |17-17| caper |18-18| movie |19-19| , &quot; |20-21| the story |22-23| of a |24-25| successful |27-27| coup |26-26| , |28-28| a |29-30| betrayal |31-31| - as |32-33| , |34-34| for example |35-36| , |37-37| in |38-38| the |39-39| Ocean &apos;s |41-42| trilogy |40-40| eleven |43-43| , |44-44| twelve |45-45| and |46-46| thirteen |47-47| . |48-48|

 Ben |0-0| Affleck |1-1| has |2-2| managed to |3-4| restart |5-5| his career |6-7| so |8-9| remarkable . |10-11| 
 actor |0-1| ridiculed |2-2| , |3-3| he |4-4| became |5-6| a |7-7| respected |11-11| director |8-10| and |12-13| acting |14-16| ceased |17-18| to generate |19-20| ironic comments |21-23| . |24-24| 
 ARGO is |0-1| his third |2-3| feature film |4-6| after |7-7| the |8-8| dark |9-9| policeman |10-10| &quot; |11-11| Gone |12-12| Baby |13-13| Gone |14-14| &quot; ( |15-16| 2007 |17-17| ) |18-18| and |19-19| the |20-20| thriller |21-21| &quot; The |22-23| Town |24-24| &quot; ( |25-26| 2010 |27-27| ) |28-28| . |29-29|

 the |0-0| meaning of |1-2| the atmosphere |3-4| of a |5-6| place |7-7| is one of the |8-11| characteristics that |12-13| would put |14-14| his first films |15-17| above the |18-21| Hollywood |23-23| standards |22-22| . |24-24| 
 Affleck |0-0| is also |1-2| proof of |3-4| the sense |5-6| of |7-7| the atmosphere |8-9| in |10-10| Argo |11-11| where |12-12| the role |13-14| of Tehran |15-16| &quot; |17-17| is required |18-19| &quot; |20-20| by Canada |21-23| . |24-24| 
 the best |0-1| scenes from the film |2-4| takes place |5-6| in |7-7| the |8-8| streets |9-9| , |10-10| in |11-12| the reconstruction |13-14| of |15-15| real facts |16-17| ; |18-18| the |19-19| initial |21-21| sequence |20-20| of |22-22| the fall |23-24| of |25-25| the embassy |26-27| is impressive |28-29| in its clarity |30-32| , which |33-33| also suggests |34-35| the confusion |36-37| and |38-38| unpredictability |39-40| arising |41-41| when |42-42| suddenly , |43-44| in |45-45| a |46-46| given place |47-48| , |49-49| has |50-50| written a |51-52| page |53-53| of history |54-55| . |56-56| 
 Affleck |0-0| and |1-1| his colleagues |2-3| have |4-4| a |5-5| similar effect |6-7| in the |8-9| fictional |11-11| scenes |10-10| ( |12-12| the false |13-14| film crew |15-17| in the |18-19| Tehran |21-22| bazaar |20-20| ) |23-23| . |24-24| 
 too many |0-1| shares |2-2| in |3-3| too many places |4-6| 
 the |0-0| director |1-3| had to |4-5| settle for |6-8| a subject |9-10| that does |11-12| in fact |13-14| that few |15-17| exciting |19-19| scenes |18-18| , |20-20| the |21-21| film |23-23| sense |22-22| of the term |24-25| . |26-26| 
 he |0-0| is doing |1-3| very well |4-5| , |6-6| he |7-7| adds |8-8| some |9-10| elements to |11-12| the reality |13-14| and there , |15-17| the result |18-19| is not |20-22| always as |23-24| elegant |25-25| ( |26-26| the scene |27-28| in which |29-30| the threat |31-32| of crisis |33-34| at |35-35| the Tehran airport |36-39| is |40-40| ruled out |41-41| by |42-42| a phone call |43-46| in America |47-48| and |49-49| the continued |50-51| on |52-52| the airstrip |53-56| are quite |57-58| farfetched |59-62| ) |63-63| . |64-64| 
 the weakness |0-1| of |2-2| Argo |3-3| lies in |4-5| its character |6-7| dispelled |8-8| , |9-9| due to |10-11| the need |12-13| to show |14-15| too many |16-17| things to |18-19| too many |20-21| different locations |22-23| . |24-24| 
 if it |0-1| is true |2-3| that |4-4| Alan |5-5| Arkin |6-6| and John |7-8| Goodman |9-9| are |10-10| quite |11-13| charming |14-14| in their |15-16| role as |17-18| Hollywood |20-20| cooperators |19-19| , |21-21| their |22-22| characters |23-23| would have |24-24| deserved |25-25| a |26-26| larger |28-29| place |27-27| and |30-30| it is not |31-34| far from |35-39| the only ones |40-41| in |42-42| this case |43-44| . |45-45| 
 the film |0-1| of |2-2| Affleck |3-3| lack |4-4| a bit |5-6| of |7-7| dramatic |9-9| tension |8-8| , |10-10| he |11-11| is |12-13| seen |14-14| with |15-15| a |16-16| moderate |18-18| interest |17-17| , |19-19| appreciating |20-21| the achievement |22-23| and |24-24| the |25-25| retro |27-27| style |26-26| of the |28-28| 1970s |29-30| . |31-31| 
 it |0-0| leads to |1-1| the viewer |2-3| , |4-4| but |5-5| with difficulty |6-7| . |8-8| 
 as a |0-2| reminder |3-3| of a |4-5| story |6-6| yet |7-7| , |8-8| in a way , |9-13| progress |14-14| to date , |15-18| and |19-19| as |20-20| the exaggerated |22-24| illustration |21-21| of the representation of the |25-28| secret services |29-30| as |31-31| omnipotent |32-32| and |33-33| omniscient |34-34| , |35-35| he |36-36| made |37-37| the case |38-39| . |40-40|

 the server |0-1| www.bankovnipoplatky.com |2-2| , which |3-4| conducts an annual |5-8| public inquiry into |9-11| the |12-12| bank charges |13-14| the most |15-16| absurd |17-17| , |18-18| has |19-19| now decided |20-24| to launch |25-26| the competition |27-28| rules |29-30| or |31-31| ideas |32-33| from |34-36| the workshop |38-39| &quot; |37-37| EU &quot; |40-41| the most |42-43| absurd |44-44| . |45-45| 
 &quot; |0-0| the fact |1-2| that |3-3| the EU |4-5| is considering |6-6| , |7-7| recently |8-10| , |11-11| to adopt |12-13| a quota |14-15| of |16-16| 40 |17-17| percent |18-20| of women |21-22| in |23-23| the direction |24-25| of large |26-27| European companies |28-29| was |30-31| at |32-32| the origin |33-34| of |35-35| our decision |36-37| , &quot; said |38-41| to |42-42| the newspaper |43-44| Právo |45-45| the organizer |46-47| of this |48-49| investigation |50-50| , |51-51| Patrik |52-52| Nacher |53-53| . |54-54| 
 among the |0-1| absurdities |2-2| mentioned |3-3| , |4-4| there are |5-7| already |8-8| , |9-9| for example |10-11| , |12-12| the |13-13| recent decision |14-15| of the |16-17| European Court |18-19| to unify |20-21| the insurance premiums |22-25| for men |26-28| and |29-29| women |30-31| . |32-32| 
 so far |0-2| , however |3-3| , |4-4| women |5-6| were |7-7| an advantage |8-8| in terms |9-12| of |13-13| life insurance |15-19| rates |14-14| because |20-21| they represent |22-23| , |24-24| objectively , |25-26| a lower |27-28| risk |29-29| for insurance companies |30-34| . |35-35| 
 people |0-1| can report |2-3| until |4-5| the end |6-7| of |8-8| the year |9-10| another |11-12| incredible |14-15| idea |13-13| of |16-16| &quot; |17-17| the workshop |18-19| of |20-20| the EU |21-22| . &quot; |23-24|

 among the |0-1| EU &apos;s |4-6| controversial |3-3| regulations |2-2| is found |7-8| , |9-9| for example |10-11| , |12-12| the obligation |13-14| to add |15-16| components |17-18| bio |19-19| fuels |20-21| , |22-22| which |23-24| has |25-25| detrimental consequences |26-28| for |29-29| the environment |30-31| , |32-32| or |33-33| the |34-34| prohibition on the use of |35-38| reliable |39-39| mercury |42-42| thermometers |40-41| , |43-43| only because they |44-47| contain a |48-49| relatively small amount |50-52| of a hazardous substance |53-56| or |57-58| the directive |59-60| on |61-61| the size |62-63| of the cages |64-65| of |66-66| chickens |67-67| , |68-68| which resulted in |69-72| an increase in the |73-75| price of |76-77| eggs . |78-79| 
 critics |0-1| have also |2-3| been issued |4-5| in the past |6-8| against |9-12| the ban on |13-15| use of |16-18| the term |19-20| &quot; |21-21| spreadable |23-24| butter |22-22| &quot; |25-25| or |26-27| withdrawal from |28-29| the sale |30-31| of |32-32| conventional |34-34| bulbs |33-33| . |35-35|

 the European administration |0-2| reacts |3-3| often under |4-5| pressure from a |6-9| commercial or industrial |11-13| lobby |10-10| whose applications |14-16| are usually |17-18| held |19-19| in Brussels |20-21| by |22-22| a state |23-24| or group |25-27| of states |28-29| ( |30-30| and |31-31| the |32-32| Czech |34-34| Republic |33-33| currently imposes |35-36| applications for |37-39| its banks |40-41| by threatening |42-43| to use |44-45| its |46-46| veto |47-49| ) |50-50| . |51-51| 
 the interests |0-1| of pressure groups |2-5| are also |6-7| , |8-8| for example |9-10| , |11-12| the origin |13-14| of the |15-15| fact that |16-17| in |18-18| the Union |19-20| , bananas |21-23| must not |24-26| be |27-27| larger than |28-32| 14 |33-33| cm |34-34| or |35-35| submit an |36-37| &quot; |38-38| abnormal |40-40| curvature |39-39| . &quot; |41-42| 
 the |0-0| European Commission |1-2| has |3-4| defended |5-5| by arguing |6-7| that it |8-9| was only |10-12| harmonise |13-13| national standards |14-16| non @-@ homogeneous |17-18| complicating the |19-21| trade . |22-23| 
 standards for |0-2| fruit |3-4| and vegetables |5-6| were relaxed |7-9| despite |10-10| the opposition |11-12| of |13-13| some States |14-15| , claiming |16-17| that the |18-19| existing directives |20-21| are a waste |22-24| of |25-25| food |26-27| . |28-28| 
 the |0-0| first prize |1-2| will |3-4| be |5-5| awarded |6-6| in |7-7| this investigation |8-9| to the |10-10| EU regulation |11-14| of last year |15-18| , according to which |19-20| must appear |21-22| on the |23-24| inflatable |26-26| balloons |25-25| a warning |27-28| stating that |29-30| children under |31-35| 8 |36-36| years |37-37| must not |38-40| inflate |41-41| without |42-42| adult supervision . |43-46| 
 the EU |0-1| has made |2-3| reference to |4-5| a |6-6| US |8-8| investigation |7-7| , according to which |9-10| the |11-11| balloons are |12-13| among the |14-16| toys , |17-18| the leading cause |19-21| of death |22-23| of children |24-25| by |26-26| smothering |27-27| . |28-28| 
 a similar restriction |0-2| applies |3-4| to children |5-6| under the age of 14 |7-11| with regard to |12-16| blowing |17-17| on |18-19| trumpets |20-20| of |21-21| fair |22-22| . |23-23| 
 here |0-1| , too , |2-3| it was |4-5| bizarre |8-8| ideas |6-7| . |9-9| 
 the |0-0| following rule |1-2| on |3-3| European officials |4-6| themselves |7-9| is quite |10-11| absurd |12-12| : |13-13| because of |14-16| the sensitivity |17-18| of |19-19| the topic |20-21| for Greece |22-24| , any |25-26| person with |27-28| an official function |29-31| within the EU |32-36| cannot |37-38| use the name |39-41| &quot; |42-42| Macedonia |43-43| &quot; and |44-45| should |46-46| instead |47-51| talk |52-52| of |53-53| FYROM |54-54| ( |55-55| Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia |56-60| ) |61-61| . |62-62| 
 in collaboration |0-1| with |2-2| the association |3-4| &quot; |5-5| Laissez |6-6| Faire &quot; |7-8| of |9-10| liberal economists |11-12| , |13-13| the server |14-15| Bankovnípoplatky.com |16-16| appointed |17-18| in |19-19| this investigation |20-21| , |22-22| in addition to |23-23| some |24-24| nonsense |25-25| mentioned |26-26| above |27-29| , the |30-31| EU |33-35| regulation |32-32| on |36-36| the volume |37-38| of reserves |39-40| of |41-41| food products |42-43| on |44-44| the territory |45-46| of |47-47| the Czech |49-49| Republic |48-48| . |50-50| 
 the EU |0-1| had |2-2| set |3-4| maximum |6-6| volumes |5-5| for |7-7| the reserves |8-9| of |10-10| food products |11-12| that may |13-13| be on |14-16| the territory |17-18| of the |19-20| Czech |22-22| Republic |21-21| on the day |23-24| of our |25-26| accession to |27-28| the EU |29-30| . |31-31| 
 the |0-0| Czech |2-2| Republic |1-1| was |3-3| second , |4-5| for example |6-7| , |8-8| the volumes |9-10| set for |11-12| canned |15-16| mushrooms |13-14| and |17-17| risked |18-18| , |19-19| therefore |20-22| , |23-23| a heavy |24-25| fine . |26-27| 
 the organizers |0-1| of |2-2| this survey |3-4| found |5-6| merit in the idea of |7-10| paying |11-12| money |13-15| to |16-16| some countries |17-18| because they |19-21| have no |22-25| access to |26-27| the sea |28-29| and |30-30| the idea of |31-33| a grant |34-36| for |37-38| the granting |39-40| of |41-41| subsidies . |42-43| 
 these ideas |0-1| , however , are not |2-5| from |6-7| Brussels |8-8| but |9-9| in Prague |10-11| . |12-12| 
 &quot; |0-0| the fact |1-2| of |3-3| not having a |4-7| sea |8-8| we |9-9| handicaps |10-10| . |11-11| 
 we will |0-1| ask |2-3| the European Union |4-6| a refund |7-8| . &quot; |9-10| thus |11-11| spoke |12-14| , |15-15| in the fall of |16-18| 2004 |19-19| , |20-20| the Minister |21-22| of |23-23| Agriculture at the time |24-28| Jaroslav |29-29| Palas |30-30| ( |31-31| ČSSD |32-32| ) |33-33| . |34-34| 
 he |0-0| argued that |1-2| , as a result |3-5| of our |6-7| wheat |9-10| production |8-8| , |11-11| and |12-12| following the |13-14| so @-@ called |16-16| &quot; |17-17| interventionist |18-18| &quot; |19-19| purchases |15-15| , |20-20| the |21-22| State |23-23| was |24-25| found |26-26| with |27-28| full |30-30| stocks |29-29| that he |31-32| had to |33-34| then |35-35| export . |36-37| 
 according to |0-0| Palas |1-1| , |2-2| the EU |3-4| would have |5-5| had to |6-7| pay |8-8| millions |9-10| of euros |11-12| , |13-13| because |14-15| the |16-16| Czech |18-18| Republic |17-17| is |19-20| far from the |21-22| ports . |23-24| 
 in the end |0-3| , |4-4| the |5-5| European Commission |6-7| responded |8-8| positively to |9-10| the request |11-12| of the Czech Republic |13-13| and |14-14| organized |15-15| a tender for |16-20| the purchase |21-22| of wheat |23-24| from countries |25-28| without access |29-30| . |31-32| 
 subsidies |0-1| for grants |2-6| have |7-7| been proposed |8-9| to the |10-10| Commons |11-11| by the |12-13| Ministry of |14-15| Local Development |16-17| headed by |18-19| the Minister |20-21| Pavel |22-22| Němec |23-23| ( US |24-25| @-@ |26-26| DEU |27-27| ) |28-28| , |29-29| they should |30-33| , |34-34| in practice , |35-36| be used to |37-38| write |39-40| applications for |41-42| grants from |43-45| Brussels . |46-47| 
 the EU |0-1| said |2-2| : |3-3| &quot; |4-4| the |5-5| bizarre |7-7| regulations |6-6| are rare |8-9| . &quot; |10-11| 
 if |0-0| the regulations |1-2| are |3-3| often criticised |4-6| in the Member States |7-10| , |11-11| according to many |12-14| experts , |15-16| the efforts of |17-20| the |21-21| EU |22-22| in regulating |23-26| and improving |27-30| the effectiveness |31-32| of the functioning |33-34| of |35-35| the Union |36-37| as well as |38-39| in the area |40-42| of its |43-44| overall development |45-46| , |47-47| rather |49-49| deserve |48-48| praise |50-51| . |52-52| 
 more serious |0-1| is |2-2| , |3-3| for example |4-5| , |6-6| according to |7-7| the experts |8-9| , |10-10| the problem |11-12| of |13-13| the use |14-15| of |16-16| EU grants |17-20| for projects |21-23| that have absolutely |24-27| nothing to |28-29| do with |30-31| the strengthening |32-33| of European integration |34-37| , |38-38| but |39-39| which have |40-41| been |42-42| imposed by |43-44| the Member States |45-47| in the budget negotiations |48-51| . |52-52| 
 the fact |0-1| that the |2-3| Czech |5-5| Republic |4-4| should |6-6| , like |7-8| other |9-10| EU countries |11-14| , |15-15| fighting |16-17| in Brussels |18-19| for |20-20| the right |21-22| to use |23-24| specific names |25-27| for these |28-29| traditional |31-31| products |30-30| ( |32-32| fight |33-33| which it |34-35| does |36-37| not always |38-39| winner |40-40| ) |41-41| raises |42-43| strong emotions |44-45| among |46-46| the Czechs |47-48| . |49-49| 
 if |0-0| after |1-3| six years |4-5| of |6-6| battle against |7-8| the Germans |9-10| and |11-11| the Austrians |12-13| , |14-14| Czechs |15-16| have |17-17| successfully defended |18-20| the name |21-22| &quot; |23-23| Olomoucké |24-24| tvarůžky |25-25| , &quot; |26-27| for |28-28| which |29-30| the |31-32| appellation |33-33| &quot; |34-34| Tuzemský |35-35| rum |36-36| &quot; |37-37| dating back |38-39| home |40-41| in the 19th |42-43| century |44-44| , |45-45| our producers |46-47| had to |48-49| replace it with |50-52| the name |53-54| &quot; |55-55| Tuzemák |56-56| . &quot; |57-58| 
 only the |0-1| alcohol @-@ based |3-6| products |2-2| of sugar |7-8| cane |9-10| , |11-11| and not |12-14| based on sugar |15-18| beet |19-20| , |21-21| may bear |22-23| the name |24-25| of rum |26-27| . |28-28|

 people want |0-2| that |3-3| I |4-4| will save |5-5| the Republic |6-7| , |8-8| but I |9-10| &apos;m only |11-13| an amateur |14-15| , |16-16| expresses |17-18| Senator |19-19| Okamura |20-20| 
 Mr |0-0| Senator |1-2| , how |3-4| was |5-9| the idea |10-11| to stand in |12-15| presidential elections |16-17| ? |18-18| 
 this is not |0-3| to be a |4-5| senator |6-6| or |7-7| president who |8-9| account |10-10| for me |11-12| . |13-13| 
 if everything |0-1| was functioning |2-2| without |3-3| problems in |4-5| our country |6-7| , |8-8| I wouldn |9-11| candidate |12-12| anywhere |13-14| . |15-15| 
 but I |0-1| can no longer bear |2-4| to see |5-6| as |7-7| the country |8-9| was |10-10| looted |11-11| over the |12-13| past 20 |14-15| years , |16-17| that |18-18| the thieves |19-20| are not |21-23| behind bars |24-26| and |27-27| taxes |28-29| and |30-30| the |31-31| retirement |33-37| age |32-32| rises . |38-39| 
 I had no |0-3| ambition |4-5| to become |6-7| a politician . |8-9| 
 but when |0-1| I see |2-3| something that |4-6| doesn |7-7| &apos;t please |9-10| me |8-8| , so |11-12| I try |13-14| to find a solution |15-18| for |19-19| that |20-20| change |21-22| . |23-23| 
 and |0-0| as |1-1| I have |2-3| more than |4-5| 40 years |6-7| and that |8-9| I |10-10| am independent |11-12| , |13-13| a member of any party |14-17| , |18-18| I have no |19-22| other options |23-25| to influence |26-27| the situation |28-29| for me to stand |30-33| in the |34-34| presidential |36-36| or |37-37| senatorial |38-38| elections |35-35| . |39-39| 
 you entered the |0-3| Senate |4-4| but |5-5| you have |6-8| put |9-9| quickly |10-10| en route |11-12| to |13-13| the Castle |14-15| ( |16-16| her |17-18| seat of |19-20| the presidency |21-22| . |23-24| 
 is it |0-2| that you |3-4| do not turn |5-7| our backs |8-10| on those who |11-13| elected you |14-16| ? |17-17| 
 I have |0-1| always said |2-3| that |4-4| I |5-5| am |6-7| in |8-8| the battle for the |9-12| Château |13-13| depending on |14-14| the results |15-16| of the |17-17| senatorial elections |18-19| 
 subsequently , |0-3| I |4-5| said |6-6| that if |7-8| I was |9-10| elected |11-11| senator |12-12| , |13-13| I |14-15| would put up |16-16| to the |17-17| presidential elections |18-19| . |20-20| 
 my goal |0-1| is not |2-4| the function |5-6| , |7-7| it |8-10| is only |11-13| an instrument |14-15| allowing me |16-17| to realize |18-19| my vision |20-21| . |22-22| 
 that is why |0-2| I need |3-6| the influence |7-8| the largest |9-11| and |12-13| broadest |15-17| mandate |14-14| . |18-18| 
 the problem |0-1| is not just |2-5| that |6-6| as a nation |7-10| we |11-11| râlons |12-12| at the bar |13-14| or |15-15| in front of |16-16| our |17-17| television |19-20| station |18-18| , |21-21| but also |22-25| that |26-26| we are stalling |27-28| all those |29-30| who are trying |31-32| to make |33-34| the change |35-36| . |37-37| 
 added to this is |0-3| the press |4-5| who |6-6| breaks |7-7| the |8-8| reputation of individuals |9-11| and |12-12| confuses |13-13| freedom of speech |14-16| with |17-17| freedom |18-18| to lie |19-20| . |21-21| 
 it was |0-1| , |2-2| for example |3-4| , |5-5| said |6-6| in |7-7| my statement |8-9| that |10-10| I |11-11| bribes |12-12| journalists |13-14| or |15-15| that |16-16| I was |17-19| the adviser |20-21| of |22-22| Jiří |23-23| Paroubek |24-24| . |25-25| 
 turning |0-2| to |3-3| your visions |4-5| . |6-6| 
 you have |0-1| started |2-2| the fight |3-4| for |5-5| the castle |6-7| with a |8-9| hobbyhorse |10-12| themes |13-14| of |15-15| material |18-18| and criminal |19-20| responsibility |16-17| of politicians |21-22| and |23-24| retroactive |27-27| tax returns |25-26| beyond |28-31| twenty |32-32| million |33-33| &#91; |34-34| CK |35-36| &#93; |37-37| . |38-38| 
 to |2-2| this end , |3-4| you have to |0-1| change |5-5| the law |6-7| . |8-8| 
 as president |0-3| , |4-4| you do not have |5-9| such a |10-11| power and |12-13| only the |14-15| Senate |16-16| as a whole |17-19| may |20-20| propose laws |21-23| . |24-24| 
 how |0-0| do you want to |1-3| solve this |4-5| problem ? |6-7| 
 when |0-0| as a citizen |1-4| , |5-5| I have |6-7| pushed for |8-11| the activities |12-13| of |14-14| a tourist guide |15-16| is a |17-18| liberal profession |19-20| , |21-21| I have |22-23| been successful |24-27| . |28-28| 
 the problem is |0-3| politics |4-5| : |6-6| when |7-7| someone |8-9| comes |10-10| from |11-11| the left or the right |12-15| with |16-16| a good |17-18| project , |19-20| it |21-23| is |24-24| knowingly |25-25| refused |26-26| and it |27-28| delays |29-29| the citizens |30-31| . |32-32| 
 as an independent |0-1| , |2-2| a member of any party |3-6| , |7-7| I have |8-9| a lot |10-10| more likely to |11-14| get |15-15| the support |16-17| of |18-18| all |19-20| parliamentary parties |21-22| . |23-23| 
 I have the |0-2| advantage of being able to |3-5| , |6-6| without |7-7| categorization and |8-9| partisan |11-11| dogma |10-10| , |12-12| take |13-14| each party |15-16| what |17-18| is best |19-23| for |24-24| our country |25-26| and |27-27| implement it |28-31| . |32-32| 
 you think of yourself |0-2| as |3-4| a man |5-6| of |7-7| the right or |8-9| left |10-11| ? |12-12| 
 a |0-1| Czech |5-5| point of view |2-4| , |6-6| I have |7-8| the impression |9-10| that people |11-13| put |15-15| me |14-14| on |16-17| the left . |18-19| 
 for me |0-1| , |2-2| that this |3-4| is |5-5| a bit |6-7| to the left or right |8-12| , |13-13| it is not |14-17| really important |18-19| . |20-20| 
 for me |0-1| , |2-2| the |3-3| important thing |4-5| is that |6-7| we move forward |8-12| . |13-13| 
 what counts |0-2| for me |3-4| , |5-5| it is not that |6-10| people |11-12| are |13-13| left or right |14-18| , but |19-19| to bring people together |20-23| . |24-24| 
 I |0-0| always |2-2| support |1-1| any solution |3-4| that contribute |5-5| to the |6-6| common good |7-8| , even |9-10| if it |11-12| is |13-13| proposed by |14-15| the Communist Party |16-18| , or |19-19| ODS |20-20| and |21-21| I act |22-23| as |24-25| impartially |26-26| against |27-30| bad ideas |31-32| . |33-33| 
 do you |0-4| enragez |5-5| when |6-6| someone |7-8| said |9-9| to |10-10| you |11-11| that |12-12| you are |13-14| a populist |15-16| ? |17-17| 
 but |0-0| what you have |1-4| said |5-5| the |6-7| proves |8-8| he not |9-13| ? |14-14| 
 when |0-0| you develop |1-2| a |3-3| business plan |4-5| in |6-6| a company |7-8| , |9-9| you also have |10-12| a certain |13-14| optimal |16-16| goal |15-15| and vision |17-19| . |20-20| 
 you try to |0-2| bring |5-5| you |3-4| . |6-6| 
 some may |0-1| call it |2-3| populism |4-5| , |6-6| but |7-7| all the proposals |8-10| which I |11-12| spoke |13-13| were |14-15| applied by |16-17| the world |18-19| and |20-20| recognized experts |21-23| have |24-25| spoken |26-26| . |27-27| 
 but |0-0| without the support |1-3| of the parliament |4-5| , |6-6| you only have |7-11| slogans |12-13| . |14-14| 
 you do |0-1| not |3-3| certain |2-2| a long time |4-4| in politics |5-6| with |7-7| this . |8-9| 
 do you think |0-3| if |4-4| you are going to |5-6| see |7-7| people |8-9| and |10-10| talk to them |11-12| , |13-13| you will succeed |14-15| , |16-16| for example |17-18| , |19-19| to impose |20-21| the |22-22| material |24-24| and criminal |25-26| responsibility |23-23| ? |27-27| 
 I have no |0-3| other option . |4-7| 
 I have to |0-2| convince |3-3| politicians |4-5| , |6-6| journalists |7-8| and public opinion |9-12| and |13-13| try to |14-15| win them over |16-17| to |18-18| my |19-19| camp |20-20| to |21-22| impose it |23-24| . |25-25| 
 if |0-0| I was |1-2| elected president |3-4| , |5-5| this |6-6| would not be |7-9| a problem |10-11| to broadcast |12-13| live on television |14-18| my request |19-20| to the chairmen of the |21-23| parliamentary parties |24-25| to legislate |26-27| on the |28-29| material |31-31| and criminal |32-33| responsibility |30-30| of politicians |34-35| , |36-36| civil servants , |37-38| judges and |39-40| prosecutors . |41-42| 
 they should |0-1| then |2-2| possibly |3-3| explain why |4-5| they |6-6| do |7-8| not want |9-10| . |11-11| 
 when there is |0-3| a |4-4| strong personality |5-6| that |7-7| will identify |8-8| abuse |9-10| , |11-11| it will be |12-13| possible to |14-15| put pressure |16-17| on |18-18| the political scene |19-21| . |22-22| 
 take , for example , |0-2| the election |3-4| of the president |5-6| by popular vote , |7-10| it |11-11| was |12-13| obtained |14-14| through |15-16| the |17-17| pressure of public opinion |18-22| . |23-23| 
 I confess |0-1| , |2-2| bluntly |3-4| , |5-5| be |6-6| an amateur |7-8| , |9-9| and not |10-11| a genius |12-13| or |14-14| an intellectual . |15-17| 
 I am trying |0-1| to |2-2| find allies |3-5| for |6-6| my views |7-8| and |9-9| my |10-10| visions |11-11| . |12-12| 
 I just |0-2| throw myself |3-4| in politics |5-6| and |7-7| I am trying |8-9| to get |10-11| the support |12-13| of |14-14| the majority |15-16| of my |17-18| program . |19-20| 
 I am trying |0-1| , |2-2| alone , |3-4| to move forward |5-9| , |10-10| and |11-11| if it doesn &apos;t work |12-16| , |17-17| I &apos;ll quit |18-19| in six |20-21| years |22-22| and |23-23| I will return to the |24-27| private sector |28-29| . |30-30| 
 it is a |0-2| bit like |3-4| if |5-5| Okamura |6-6| was to |7-7| save the |8-9| Czech |11-11| Republic |10-10| . |12-12| 
 I |0-0| am not |1-3| a savior |4-5| . |6-6| 
 I know |0-1| that one person |2-5| can &apos;t |6-8| make a difference |9-11| , |12-12| which is why |13-15| I |16-16| went to see |17-19| a |20-20| number of |21-22| personalities to |23-24| ask them |25-26| to present themselves |27-29| as |30-30| the |31-31| senatorial elections |32-33| . |34-34| 
 I met |0-2| Radim |3-3| Jančura |4-4| , |5-5| but |6-6| he refused |7-9| because of |10-12| the amount |13-14| of work |15-16| . |17-17| 
 at least |2-3| I have |0-1| supported the |4-5| investigative journalist |6-8| Jana |9-9| Lorencová |10-10| which |11-11| revealed |12-13| the |14-14| fraud |15-15| with oil |16-17| . |18-18| 
 I |0-0| introduced myself |1-3| because people |4-7| are really |8-9| angry |10-10| , but |11-11| now |12-12| I hesitate |13-14| . |15-15| 
 sixty |0-0| percent |1-2| of the people |3-4| did not vote |5-8| , and |9-9| what |10-11| did |12-14| have |15-15| , |16-16| for the most part , |17-20| given their |21-22| voice to |23-24| a representative |25-26| of the |27-28| establishment |29-29| . |30-30| 
 in the Senate |0-1| , |2-2| we are only |3-6| two |7-7| independent . |8-9| 
 people |0-1| have |2-2| elected a |3-4| Senate |5-5| that |6-6| will be difficult to |7-8| impose changes |9-11| . |12-12| 
 despite everything |0-1| , |2-2| I will fight |3-4| for |5-5| my vision |6-7| , |8-8| for example |9-10| the direct election |11-15| of mayors |16-17| and |18-19| prefects |20-20| of |21-21| regions . |22-23| 
 do you plan |0-2| to base |3-4| your |5-5| own party |6-7| ? |8-8| 
 no , |0-1| not yet |2-3| , |4-4| because |5-6| I do not have |7-10| the time to |11-13| check whether |14-15| the past |16-17| of each |18-19| potential member |20-21| is |22-22| spotless |23-24| and |25-25| then |26-26| I don &apos;t have |27-31| the financial means |32-34| . |35-35| 
 I |0-0| have no |1-4| more money |5-7| for my |8-9| presidential campaign |10-11| , I did |12-15| that |16-16| twenty thousand |17-18| on |19-19| my account |20-21| &quot; |22-22| transparent |23-23| . &quot; |24-25| 
 you don &apos;t have |0-3| money |4-5| ? |6-6| 
 you talk about |0-2| tax returns |3-4| , |5-5| what is |6-7| yours |8-9| ? |10-10| 
 I think |0-1| about |2-3| 60 |4-4| million |5-5| worth of |6-8| my |9-9| personal property |10-11| . |12-12| 
 I was |0-1| in Prague |2-3| land |4-5| worth $ |6-9| 25 |10-10| million |11-11| , |12-12| an apartment |13-14| worth $ |15-18| 10 |19-19| million |20-20| , |21-21| another |22-23| apartment |24-24| worth |25-25| 8 |26-26| million |27-27| , |28-28| a collection |29-30| of works |31-32| of art |33-34| worth about $ |35-39| 10 |40-40| million |41-41| , |42-42| an |43-43| Aston |44-44| Martin |45-45| worth |46-47| 3.5 |48-48| million |49-49| and |50-50| a |51-51| Skoda |52-52| Superb |53-53| worth $ |54-57| 1 million |58-59| and |60-60| a few million |61-62| on |63-63| my |64-64| account . |65-66| 
 incidentally |0-3| , |4-4| I have |5-6| an |7-7| Aston |8-8| Martin |9-9| , |10-10| because |11-12| it was a |13-15| kid |18-18| &apos;s dream |16-17| : |19-19| I have |20-21| always loved |22-23| James |24-24| Bond , |25-26| travelling |27-28| by car |29-30| , |31-31| was |32-32| with |33-34| women |35-36| and |37-37| fought |38-39| against evil |40-42| and abuse |43-45| . |46-46| 
 you drive |0-2| Aston |3-3| Martin |4-4| , |5-5| you have |6-7| a legacy |8-9| worth $ |10-13| 60 |14-14| million |15-15| and |16-16| you don &apos;t have |17-20| money for |21-23| your campaign |24-25| ? |26-26| 
 you want to |0-1| change |2-2| the Republic |3-4| but |5-5| you don &apos;t want to |6-9| invest |10-11| your |12-12| own money |13-14| ? |15-15| 
 this is not |0-3| very |4-4| convincing . |5-6| 
 I did not |0-3| 15 |4-4| million |5-5| for |6-6| this campaign |7-8| . |9-9| 
 I should |0-2| into debt |3-3| ? |4-4| 
 I have |0-1| already |2-2| invested $ |3-3| 2 |4-4| million |5-5| and |6-6| a half |7-7| in |8-8| the campaign |9-10| . |11-11| 
 the fact |0-1| that |2-2| I have no |3-6| sponsor |7-7| shows |8-9| that my |10-11| programme does not generate |12-15| a lot of interest |16-18| . |19-19| 
 I do not have |0-3| the obligation |4-5| to pay |6-7| this campaign |8-9| in |10-10| my pocket |11-12| . |13-13| 
 my |0-0| campaign |2-3| costs |1-1| are |4-4| generally |5-5| covered by |6-7| the compensation that |8-10| I will receive |11-12| as a senator |13-16| . |17-17| 
 but |0-0| I could not |1-4| live |5-6| , |7-7| for example , |8-9| pay |10-10| the English school |11-13| of |14-14| my son |15-16| , which costs |17-18| 30 |19-19| thousand |20-20| per month |21-22| . |23-23| 
 if my |0-1| only goal |2-3| was to |4-5| make money |6-9| , |10-10| I |11-13| will present |14-14| in any elections |15-17| . |18-18| 
 you will |0-1| therefore continue |2-3| your commercial activities |4-6| in order to |7-8| live |9-9| ? |10-10| 
 didn |0-1| &apos;t you |2-4| said |5-5| that |6-6| you would put |7-8| your activities |9-10| under wraps |11-12| ? |13-13| 
 but |0-0| this is not |1-4| linked |5-5| to the amount |6-7| of the remuneration |8-10| . |11-11| 
 as I |0-3| promised , |4-5| I |6-7| partially |8-8| reduced |9-9| my activities |10-11| . |12-12| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| my assistant |3-4| will take |5-5| in the spring of |6-7| the direction |8-9| of |10-10| the travel agency |11-14| . |15-15| 
 people |0-1| want |2-2| that I am |3-5| a |6-6| Samaritan |7-7| who saves |8-9| the Republic |10-11| . |12-12| 
 but I feel |0-4| I live |5-6| for |7-7| something |8-9| . |10-10| 
 what was |0-1| your |2-2| usual |5-5| monthly salary |3-4| when |6-6| you were |7-8| entrepreneur |9-9| ? |10-10| 
 I won |0-1| and |2-2| I continue |3-4| to earn |5-6| between |7-7| two hundred |8-9| and |10-10| four |11-11| hundred thousand |12-13| . |14-14| 
 if I were |0-2| president |3-3| , |4-4| I would put |5-6| an end to |7-8| my |9-9| business activities |10-11| . |12-12| 
 you will find |0-1| this interview |2-3| in |4-5| Saturday &apos;s |7-8| edition |6-6| of the |9-9| journal |10-10| Práva |11-11| . |12-12| 
 the architects |0-1| of the firm |2-3| MVRDV |4-4| prove that |5-6| the true |7-8| adventures |9-9| are not just |10-13| a matter of |14-15| imagination |16-16| . |17-17| for proof , |18-22| just |23-25| look at |26-26| Spijkenisse |27-27| and |28-28| the mountain |29-30| of books |31-32| newly |33-33| erected |34-34| - |35-35| 2 |36-36| photos |37-37| 
 &quot; I |0-1| think |2-3| it |4-5| &apos;s funny |6-7| , it |8-9| is |10-10| very |11-11| futuristic , |12-13| finally |14-14| something interesting |15-18| to |19-19| see |20-20| , &quot; said |21-24| Lisette |25-25| Verhaig |26-26| , |27-27| a shopper |28-29| on |30-30| the side of |31-35| the street |36-37| . |38-38| 
 Stefan |0-0| Spermon |1-1| , |2-2| a computer scientist |3-4| in a |5-6| large company |7-8| , |9-10| we |11-11| said |12-12| : |13-13| &quot; |14-14| yes |15-15| , it |16-17| is |18-19| all well and good |20-21| , |22-22| this building |23-24| . &quot; |25-26| 
 but I |0-1| wonder |2-3| why |4-4| we still need |5-8| today |9-10| a library . |11-14| 
 everyone |0-2| has |3-3| the Internet |4-4| , |5-5| an iPad |6-7| and |8-9| e |10-10| @-@ books |11-12| . |13-13| 
 today |0-1| , nobody |2-5| will |6-6| voluntarily |7-10| in one |11-12| of these |13-14| elderly |16-16| libraries |15-15| , |17-17| no ? |18-19| 
 Spijkenisse |0-0| , |1-1| a dormitory |2-5| that |6-6| is not |7-10| attractive |11-11| to the |12-12| gates of |13-14| Rotterdam , |15-16| holds |17-17| a record |18-19| specific |21-21| enough |20-20| . |22-22| 
 the town |0-1| of |2-2| 80,000 |3-3| souls |4-4| has the |5-6| lowest |10-12| rate |7-7| of education |8-9| of the |13-13| Netherlands |14-16| . |17-17| 
 in order to |0-1| restore |2-2| some |3-3| neurons |4-4| in the |5-5| brains |6-6| , |7-7| the city |8-9| decided |10-12| a few years |16-17| ago |13-15| , |18-19| contribute to |20-21| the |22-22| general culture |23-24| and |25-26| reproduce |27-27| the seven |28-29| fictitious |31-31| bridges |30-30| that appear |32-33| on the |34-35| euro |37-38| banknotes |36-36| in the form |39-41| of |42-42| pretty |43-43| small |44-44| reinforced concrete |46-48| painted |49-49| miniatures |45-45| . |50-50| 
 the success |0-1| of the |2-3| cultural |5-5| offensive |4-4| remained |6-7| limited . |8-9| 
 that is how |0-3| the city authorities |4-8| realized |9-12| that there was |13-17| only one way to |18-22| regain |23-23| control of |24-26| the statistics |27-28| : |29-29| the |30-30| construction of |31-32| a library |33-34| ! |35-35| 
 Winy |0-0| Maas , |1-2| the office |3-4| of architects |5-6| MVRDV |9-9| Rotterdam |7-8| , |10-10| master |11-11| of |12-12| bar charts |13-15| bold and |16-17| creator of |18-19| witty |21-23| buildings |20-20| and often |24-25| cynical |26-26| , |27-27| accepted |28-28| the project |29-30| with |31-31| his usual unflappability |32-34| and |35-35| ran |36-37| in the competition |38-39| in 2003 |40-41| with |42-42| five |43-43| books |44-44| under his arm |45-47| and |48-48| a |49-49| sneer |50-50| on |51-51| his face |52-53| . |54-54| 
 and |0-0| while |1-2| the members of the |3-5| jury is |6-7| still |9-9| watched |8-8| , |10-10| puzzled and |11-12| shrugging our shoulders |13-15| , |16-16| Maas , |17-18| the brash |19-20| , |21-21| empila |22-22| his books |23-24| of choice |25-26| by |27-27| order of |28-29| size |30-30| into |31-33| a pyramid |34-35| , |36-36| and |37-37| ended his speech |38-40| buttressed |41-41| arguments |42-43| by |45-46| activists |44-44| : |47-47| &quot; |48-48| dear |49-49| ! |50-51| &quot; |52-52| 
 so |0-1| , |2-2| my proposal |3-4| for |5-5| the mountain |6-7| of books |8-9| of |10-10| Spijkenisse |11-11| , |12-12| or |13-13| as they say |14-16| , the |17-18| Boekenberg |19-19| ! |20-20| 
 nine |0-0| years later |1-3| , |4-4| the mountain |5-6| of |7-7| 30 |8-8| million euros |9-11| has sprung up |12-15| . |16-16| 
 the building |0-1| is part of |2-4| a |5-5| revitalization project |6-8| that also has an |9-11| underground car park |12-13| , |14-14| a supermarket |15-16| , |17-17| a |18-18| post office and |19-22| a few |23-23| buildings and |24-25| townhouses |26-27| for a total |28-30| of |31-31| 50 |32-32| homes |33-33| . |34-34| 
 in early November |0-1| , |2-2| the mountain |3-4| of books |5-6| received |7-8| the |9-9| second prize |10-11| &quot; |12-12| Best |13-13| Library of |14-15| NL |16-16| 2012 |17-17| . &quot; |18-19| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| the project |3-4| was |5-6| selected for |7-8| the |9-9| Dutch National |10-11| Wood |12-12| Award |13-13| 2012 |14-14| . |15-15| 
 thus , |0-3| this |4-4| small town |5-6| dull , |7-8| which |9-9| until |10-11| now |12-13| had nothing |14-16| more |17-18| to offer |19-20| than a |21-22| postmodern |25-25| pedestrian zone |23-24| and |26-26| a |27-27| mayor |28-28| of a |29-30| staggering |32-32| ugliness |31-31| , |33-33| whose |34-35| white |37-37| façades |36-36| invite |38-38| suggests |39-40| that |41-41| they support |42-43| a dairy |44-45| , |46-46| has been enriched |47-49| by a |50-51| contemporary |54-54| architectural work |52-53| . |55-55| 
 the |0-0| most important thing is |1-5| that |6-6| Spijkenisse |7-7| now has |8-9| the first |10-11| public cultural |13-14| building |12-12| in its history |15-17| . |18-18| 
 the long road to |0-3| the |4-5| 
 first |0-0| impression |1-1| : |2-2| Eldorado |3-3| of the book |4-5| under |6-6| bell |7-7| to |8-8| cheese . |9-10| 
 of course , |0-1| a lift |2-3| takes you through the heart |4-7| of the |8-8| massive , |9-10| but |11-11| the real |12-13| joy of reading |14-17| and architecture |18-21| are open to you |22-25| when |26-26| you disregard |27-28| the floor |29-30| of the building |31-32| to |33-33| the discovery |34-35| of |36-36| its topography |37-38| . |39-39| 
 the Interior |0-1| made entirely of |2-4| glass is |5-6| bright |7-7| and clear |8-9| , |10-10| the |11-12| Dutch |15-15| brick |13-14| , and the |16-17| streetlights |18-18| elegant |19-19| unequivocally |21-22| speak |20-20| the language |23-24| of the |25-25| municipal |28-28| public squares |26-27| . |29-29| 
 the |0-0| urban |2-2| atmosphere |1-1| is perfect |3-4| . |5-5| 
 it |0-0| is |1-1| already |2-2| in |3-3| the |4-5| public benches |6-7| , |8-8| dogs |9-10| and small |11-13| boys and |14-15| girls |16-17| who play |18-20| the ball |21-22| . |23-23| 
 and |0-0| everywhere |1-1| books |2-3| , books |4-6| and |7-7| more |8-8| books |9-10| . |11-11| 
 &quot; |0-0| normally , |1-2| the stacks |3-6| are located |7-8| along |9-11| the facade |12-13| and |14-14| in the middle |15-16| is |17-18| a |19-19| large |21-21| , dark |22-23| room |20-20| , which |24-25| is often |26-27| uncomfortable |28-28| and impersonal |29-30| , &quot; |31-32| says |33-33| Willy |34-34| Maas |35-35| . |36-36| 
 we have |0-1| completely |2-2| changed the |3-4| classic |7-7| spatial configuration |5-6| and open |8-9| spaces |10-11| of |12-12| reading |13-13| from the |14-15| inside out |16-19| . |20-20| 
 the interior |0-1| of |2-2| the mountain |3-4| of books |5-6| was |7-8| deftly |9-9| constructed |10-10| : |11-11| in the middle |12-13| are |14-15| the offices |16-17| , |18-18| the |19-19| Internet |21-21| library |20-20| , the |22-23| chess |25-26| club |24-24| , |27-27| the centre |28-29| for |30-30| the environment |31-32| and |33-33| the |34-34| building &apos;s |37-38| technical |36-36| center |35-35| . |39-39| 
 a |0-0| special |2-2| beauty |1-1| lies in |3-4| the |5-5| black |7-7| rays |6-6| of |8-8| the library |9-10| , |11-11| which are |12-13| sometimes |14-14| panelling |15-16| , sometimes |17-18| balustrades |19-20| , sometimes |21-22| the |23-23| stair railings . |24-27| 
 a new experience for |0-3| sight , touch |4-8| and |9-9| smell |10-11| . |12-12| 
 even |0-0| the architects |1-2| and engineers |3-5| of the building |6-7| hardened |8-8| do not want |9-12| unknown |14-14| materials |13-13| . |15-15| 
 &quot; |0-0| we wanted to |1-2| work with |3-4| recycled materials |5-7| , &quot; |8-9| said |10-10| Joop |11-11| Trouborst |12-12| , |13-13| head of the |14-15| project |16-16| to |17-18| the municipality |19-20| of |21-21| Spijkenisse |22-22| , |23-23| in |24-24| a response |25-26| to the |27-27| Standard |28-28| . |29-29| 
 so |0-2| that one day |3-5| we found |6-8| in a |9-10| farming business |11-12| center with |13-13| an |14-14| ad hoc |16-17| waste |15-15| from |18-19| agriculture |20-21| . |22-22| 
 in the Netherlands |0-3| , |4-4| used |5-6| for years |7-9| of the |10-11| synthetic membrane |12-13| of a |14-15| millimetre |16-16| thick |17-18| as |19-19| substrate |20-20| in |21-21| greenhouses |22-23| and fields |24-26| . |27-27| 
 it is |0-1| cheap and |2-4| it |5-6| saves time |7-9| . |10-10| 
 the |0-0| thin membrane |1-2| is used |3-4| for one |5-6| or |7-7| two seasons |8-9| , then |10-11| we can |12-13| discard |14-15| . |16-16| 
 for |0-0| the library |1-2| , |3-3| the membrane |4-5| was |6-7| compressed |8-8| , |9-9| for the |10-11| first time |12-13| in |14-14| such |15-16| quantities |17-17| , |18-19| thick |21-23| plates |20-20| of four |24-25| centimetres |26-26| . |27-27| 
 under |0-0| the influence of heat |1-5| and pressure |6-9| , the |10-11| &quot; |12-12| Landbouwplastic |13-13| &quot; ( |14-15| KPL |16-16| ) |17-17| changes color |18-20| and |21-21| turns into |22-24| a |25-25| dark |27-27| material |26-26| , |28-28| homogeneous |29-29| and |30-30| resistant |31-31| , |32-32| whose |33-34| smell |35-35| evokes |36-36| both a |37-40| new car |41-42| and |43-44| sports footwear |45-47| . |48-48| 
 at the top |0-1| of the |2-2| 105 |3-3| marches |4-4| is |5-6| the summit |7-8| of |9-9| the mountain |10-11| . |12-12| 
 after nearly |0-3| 500 |4-4| metres |5-5| , the |6-7| literary |9-9| café |8-8| offers |10-11| a |12-12| spectacular view of |13-15| the city |16-17| , |18-18| but also |19-20| of the |21-21| Dutch |23-23| croquettes |22-22| and |24-25| potted |27-28| ficus |26-26| . |29-29| 
 they |0-1| create |2-2| an atmosphere |3-4| , |5-5| but |6-6| mostly |9-9| they contribute |7-8| to the maintenance |10-11| of the |12-12| ideal level |13-14| of humidity |15-16| of |17-17| literary |23-23| mountain |20-22| air |18-19| . |24-24| 
 donations |0-1| for |2-2| the soul |3-4| new |5-5| 
 &quot; it &apos;s |0-2| unbelievable , |3-4| but |5-5| despite |6-6| all |7-8| glass |10-11| surfaces |9-9| , |12-12| this building |13-14| is a |15-16| model project |17-18| in terms |19-20| of |21-21| ecology |22-22| , &quot; says |23-25| Trouborst |26-26| . |27-27| 
 the temperature |0-1| of |2-2| the building |3-4| is |5-5| resolved |6-6| by |7-7| geothermal energy |8-8| . |9-9| 
 although |0-0| the mountain |1-2| of books |3-4| is |5-6| below a |7-10| glass |12-13| bell |11-11| , |14-14| the sun |15-16| shines |18-18| no |17-17| little time |19-22| inside |23-24| , even |25-26| on sunny days |27-31| . |32-32| 
 the thick |0-1| wooden |3-4| beams |2-2| mounted |5-5| wrong |6-7| over |8-10| the |11-11| glass |13-14| facade |12-12| use |15-16| sun visors |17-19| , |20-20| intercepting |21-21| a |22-22| large part |23-24| of the |25-25| shelves . |26-27| 
 the |0-0| ambient |2-2| atmosphere |1-1| is very |3-4| pleasant |5-5| . |6-6| 
 the |0-0| fully |2-2| automated |3-3| blinds |1-1| can do the rest |4-7| . |8-8| 
 Stefan |0-0| Spermon |1-1| , |2-2| the |3-3| aforementioned |6-6| septic |5-5| computer scientist |4-4| , |7-7| has |8-9| already |10-10| risky |11-11| to |12-12| enter |13-14| the new |15-16| library . |17-18| 
 Lisette |0-0| Verhaig |1-1| also |2-2| was |3-3| already there |4-5| . |6-6| 
 Cynthia |0-0| Bogarde |1-1| , professor |2-3| of |4-4| traditional Chinese |6-7| medicine |5-5| , |8-8| even |10-10| the |11-11| Boekenberg |12-12| describes |9-9| as &quot; |13-14| the soul |15-16| finally |17-17| found |18-18| &quot; |19-19| of |20-20| Spijkenisse |21-21| . |22-22| 
 a few weeks |3-4| ago |0-2| , |5-7| at the inauguration |8-11| , |12-12| every citizen |13-14| has |15-15| been |16-16| invited to |17-18| donate |19-21| a book |22-23| from |24-25| his |26-26| personal |28-28| library |27-27| . |29-29| 
 this helped |0-3| to fill |4-5| the gaps |6-7| in |8-8| the library |9-10| , which |11-11| was not |12-14| yet fully |15-16| @-@ stocked |17-17| ( |18-18| today |19-20| , |21-21| there are |22-23| 70,000 |24-24| pounds |25-25| ) |26-26| . |27-27| 
 the concept |0-1| is |2-2| a success |3-4| . |5-5| 
 the shelves |0-1| are |2-2| from all sides |3-5| . |6-6| 
 for |0-0| the architect |1-2| Winy |3-3| Maas , |4-5| &quot; |6-6| there is |7-10| nothing worse than |11-14| a library |15-16| half empty |17-19| . &quot; |20-21| 
 &quot; I |0-1| think |2-3| our |4-4| invitation |5-5| has created |6-7| a certain |8-9| relationship between |10-11| each citizen |12-13| and |14-14| the |15-15| new building |16-17| . |18-18| 
 everyone knows |0-1| that |2-2| his book |3-4| is part |5-6| of this building |7-9| . |10-10| 
 even if |0-1| it is only |2-5| for decoration |6-8| . &quot; |9-10| 
 thus , |0-3| MVRDV |4-4| reached |5-6| the discipline |7-8| mistress |9-9| called |10-12| , |13-13| in |14-14| the jargon |15-16| , |17-18| &quot; |19-19| the |20-20| creation of |21-22| an identity |23-24| . &quot; |25-26| 
 Spijkenisse |0-0| wrote |1-2| a new |3-4| page |5-5| of |6-6| literary |8-8| history |7-7| . |9-9| 
 although |0-1| it |2-2| may seem |3-4| young |5-5| and poorly |6-7| educated |8-8| . |9-9| 
 it is |0-2| finally |3-3| a |4-5| new starting point for |6-10| the |11-11| birth of |12-13| an identity |14-15| . |16-16| 
 Szabo |0-0| : |1-1| &quot; |2-2| the Germans |3-4| should |5-5| play a |6-7| greater role |8-10| . &quot; |11-12| 
 Germany |0-1| has chosen |2-3| to abstain from the vote |4-8| on |9-9| the admission |10-11| of the |12-13| Palestinian state |14-15| . |16-16| 
 according to |0-0| Stephen |1-1| Szabo |2-2| , an expert |3-4| on |5-5| relations between |6-7| the United States |8-11| and |12-12| the EU |13-14| , |15-15| this decision |16-17| puts |18-18| Berlin |19-19| in a |20-21| delicate political |23-24| situation |22-22| . |25-25| 
 Deutsche |0-0| Welle |1-1| : |2-2| at the beginning |3-4| of |5-5| the week |6-7| , |8-8| Germany |9-10| had announced |11-12| his intention |13-14| to vote against |15-17| the |18-18| Palestinian |21-21| request |19-20| to obtain |22-23| the status |24-25| of |26-26| observer State |27-29| of the United Nations . |30-33| 
 but |0-0| she then |1-3| chosen |4-4| the |5-5| abstention |6-6| . |7-7| 
 why |0-0| ? . |1-1| 
 Stephen |0-0| Szabo |1-1| : |2-2| Germany |3-4| does not approve of |5-7| what |8-9| the Israelis |10-11| have done |12-13| in Gaza |14-15| . |16-16| 
 however |0-0| , Berlin |1-2| must |3-3| be cautious |4-7| , |8-8| because it |9-10| has special relations |11-14| with Israel |15-16| . |17-17| 
 but I |0-1| also think |2-3| that it |4-5| does not support |6-10| the |11-11| American position |12-13| . |14-14| 
 Germany |0-1| wanted to |2-2| assert its |3-4| independence |5-5| , |6-6| but without |7-8| being |9-10| too |11-11| critical of |12-13| Israel |14-14| . |15-15| 
 during |0-1| the uprising |2-3| in Libya |4-5| in March |6-7| 2011 |8-8| , |9-9| Germany |10-11| had also |12-13| chosen to abstain in the |14-18| vote on |19-20| the |21-21| establishment of |22-25| a no @-@ fly zone |26-30| . |31-31| 
 finally , |0-1| NATO |2-3| imposed |4-4| this measure |5-6| . |7-7| 
 Germany |0-1| finds |2-2| it |3-6| difficult to |7-9| adopt a |10-11| clear position |12-13| on |14-15| major |16-17| international issues |18-19| ? |20-20| 
 the answer is |0-2| yes |3-3| . |4-4| 
 the reason is |0-3| that |4-4| Berlin is |5-6| reviewing its |7-11| foreign policy |12-13| , |14-14| seeking to |15-16| move away from |17-19| a policy |20-21| virtually |22-24| defined by |25-26| the Americans |27-28| and |29-29| to establish |30-31| a |32-32| German |35-35| foreign policy |33-34| . |36-36| 
 moreover |0-1| , the |2-3| lack of |4-5| a common |9-9| and coherent policy |6-8| within the Union |10-14| complicates |15-15| the situation |16-17| . |18-18| 
 the Germans |0-1| are thus faced |2-4| on several |5-6| fronts . |7-8| 
 are |0-0| expected to |1-5| play a |6-7| more independent |9-10| role |8-8| , |11-11| but |12-12| they |13-13| are not |14-17| accustomed to . |18-19| 
 I think they |0-3| still |5-5| experimenting |4-4| to find |6-7| this role |8-9| , |10-10| but |11-11| are |12-12| on the path |13-15| to |16-16| a |17-17| more |21-21| &quot; |20-20| normal &quot; |22-23| foreign policy |18-19| . |24-24| 
 a |0-0| foreign policy |1-2| , |3-3| as in France |4-6| or Britain |7-11| 
 that |0-0| means |1-1| , |2-2| in practice |3-3| the term |4-6| &quot; |9-9| normal &quot; |10-11| foreign policy |7-8| for |12-12| the Germans |13-14| ? |15-15| 
 it shows |0-1| a willingness |2-3| to adopt positions |4-7| beyond |8-9| those of the |10-11| United States |12-14| and |15-16| European partners |17-18| , |19-19| including |20-21| with regard to |22-25| the |26-26| national |28-28| records |27-27| . |29-29| 
 I believe |0-1| that the |2-3| German |6-6| foreign policy |4-5| is also |7-8| determined by |9-10| its economic policy |11-13| , so |14-15| by exports |16-18| and |19-19| its relations |20-21| with |22-22| some regions |23-24| , such as |25-26| Russia |27-28| , |29-29| China |30-31| or |32-32| the |33-33| Middle |34-34| East |35-36| . |37-37| 
 the |0-0| German |3-3| economic interests |1-2| are |4-4| , |5-5| to some extent |6-9| , |10-10| different from those |11-13| of other |14-15| major powers |16-17| : |18-18| that is why |19-21| Germany |22-23| needs to |24-24| protect |25-25| its interests |26-27| . |28-28| 
 these |0-0| economic interests |1-2| have |3-5| influenced |6-6| Germany &apos;s position |7-11| vis @-@ à |12-14| @-@ |15-15| vis |16-16| the conflict |17-18| in the Middle |19-20| East |21-22| and |23-23| abstain from the vote |24-28| of the United Nations |29-31| ? |32-32| 
 Germany |0-1| was first |2-4| significant opportunities |5-7| in the Middle |8-9| East |10-11| , |12-12| especially in |13-14| the Gulf countries |15-18| . |19-19| 
 that is why |0-2| Berlin |3-3| must |4-4| take |5-5| care not to |6-9| offend |10-10| public opinion , |11-14| but also |15-16| the elites |17-18| of the Arab countries |19-21| . |22-22| 
 this is |0-3| undoubtedly |4-6| a |7-8| key element |9-10| . |11-11| 
 however , |0-1| I |2-2| do |3-4| not |6-6| give |5-5| too much |7-8| importance |9-9| , because |10-11| it |12-12| is not |13-17| exclusively |19-19| unilateral |20-20| relationship |18-18| . |21-21| 
 but that is |0-3| in |4-4| any case |5-6| a |7-7| key element |8-9| in the |10-11| German |14-14| strategic thinking |12-13| . |15-15| 
 Germany |0-1| affect |2-5| its relations |6-7| with the United States |8-12| by choosing |13-14| the |15-15| abstention |16-16| in |17-18| important votes |19-20| , |21-21| as in |22-23| the case |24-25| of |26-26| Palestine |27-28| ? |29-29| 
 I believe |0-1| that |2-2| the Europeans |3-4| and Americans |5-7| understand |8-9| the |10-10| German position |11-12| . |13-13| 
 that is why |0-2| I |3-3| think |4-5| the gap |6-7| is not |8-10| so serious |11-12| as it was |13-16| in |17-17| the case |18-19| of the |20-21| Libyan |23-23| issue |22-22| . |24-24| 
 even |0-3| that Germany |4-6| will only be more |7-11| respected . |12-13| 
 indeed |0-1| , |2-2| Germany |3-4| has thus |5-6| demonstrated that |7-8| it must |9-10| be |11-11| taken seriously |12-14| as a global player |15-19| and that |20-21| its interests |22-23| must be |24-25| taken into |26-27| account . |28-29| 
 in Europe |0-1| , |2-2| the opinions |3-4| on the |5-6| Palestinian |8-8| initiative |7-7| are diverse |9-10| . |11-11| 
 by |0-0| contrast , |1-2| the United States |3-6| announced their |7-9| veto |10-10| of a |11-12| clear voice |13-14| . |15-15| 
 the opinions |0-1| differ |2-4| between the United States |5-9| and |10-10| most |11-13| European countries |14-15| ? |16-16| 
 there have always been |0-4| differences |5-6| because of |7-9| the |10-10| US domestic |13-14| political scene |11-12| . |15-15| 
 I believe |0-1| that |2-2| the Obama administration |3-5| is |6-6| secretly |7-7| extremely understanding |8-12| toward |13-13| the |14-14| European |16-16| position |15-15| . |17-17| 
 but given |0-1| the |2-2| political |4-4| configuration |3-3| of the country |5-6| , |7-7| the government |8-9| cannot |10-11| , of course , not |12-14| defend |15-15| its position |16-17| publicly . |18-19| 
 I believe |0-1| that |2-2| the real |3-4| differences |5-5| of opinion |6-7| are not |8-10| so large that |11-13| they |14-15| always seem |16-17| . |18-18| 
 if |0-0| you look at |1-2| the relationship |3-4| between |5-5| Obama and |6-7| Israeli Prime Minister |8-11| Netanyahu |12-12| , |13-13| you will notice |14-15| that |16-16| Obama is |17-18| far from |19-20| overflow |21-21| of |22-22| enthusiasm for |23-27| the policy |28-29| of |30-30| Netanyahu |31-31| . |32-32| 
 Germany |0-1| is |2-6| struggling |7-8| to reconcile |9-10| its |11-11| close relations |12-13| with Israel |14-15| and |16-16| the United States |17-20| , |21-21| on the one hand , |22-25| with |26-26| the position |27-28| of the great |29-30| European partners |31-32| , |33-33| on the other hand |34-36| ? |37-37| 
 I |0-0| think it |1-3| does |4-4| not make things any easier |5-8| for |9-9| the Germans |10-11| . |12-12| 
 of course , |0-1| it would be |2-3| a little |4-5| easier |6-7| for |8-8| the Germans |9-10| if there was |11-13| a |14-14| coherent |17-17| and consistent |18-19| European policy |15-16| , |20-20| but |21-21| today |22-23| , |24-24| this is not |25-28| the case |29-30| . |31-31| 
 they |0-0| therefore cannot |1-4| register |5-6| within a |7-10| broader |13-14| political line |11-12| and |15-15| must |16-16| assert their |17-18| singular |20-20| position |19-19| . |21-21| 
 that is |0-1| what they |2-4| are currently |5-6| in |7-7| the issue |8-9| of |10-10| the euro |11-12| . |13-13| 
 in my opinion |0-2| , |3-3| Germany |4-5| will assume |6-6| in the future |7-9| a |10-10| locomotive |12-13| role |11-11| and |14-14| will push |15-15| Europe |16-17| to adopt |18-19| a European position |20-22| . |23-23| 
 it is not |0-3| easy for |4-5| Germany |6-7| , especially |8-9| because |10-11| of relations |12-13| with Israel |14-15| . |16-16| 
 this question |0-1| has always |2-3| been |4-4| sensitive |5-5| . |6-6| 
 but |0-0| in my opinion |1-2| , |3-3| the Germans |4-5| are well |6-7| aware |8-10| that they |11-12| must play |13-14| a role |15-16| that |17-17| is |18-18| more |19-19| independence |20-21| . |22-22| 
 Germany |0-1| will |2-3| play a |4-7| role as an |8-9| important player |10-12| on the |13-14| international stage |15-16| , |17-17| Germany |18-19| wants to |20-22| play |23-24| a |25-25| key role |26-27| ? |28-28| 
 or |0-1| does it |2-6| always |7-7| difficult to |8-10| assume |11-11| leadership roles |12-16| ? |17-17| 
 Germany |0-1| is |2-4| still not |5-6| accustomed |7-7| , |8-8| it |9-10| is always |11-12| uncomfortable |13-13| and |14-14| , |15-15| for obvious reasons |16-19| , |20-20| the country is |21-23| still |24-24| struggling |25-26| to play |27-28| a |29-29| more important role |30-32| . |33-33| 
 if |0-0| you look |1-3| , |4-4| for example |5-6| , |7-7| the euro crisis |8-12| , we |13-14| note |15-15| that every time |16-19| that Germany |20-22| decides to |23-24| weigh |25-25| more |26-26| , |27-27| many |28-29| antiallemands |31-31| sentiments |30-30| are heard |32-34| . |35-35| 
 it |0-0| does |1-1| not make things any easier |2-5| for |6-6| the Germans |7-8| . |9-9| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| it is |3-4| always the |5-6| same problem |7-8| : |9-9| we don &apos;t want to |10-13| be |14-14| surrounded |15-15| by |16-16| hostile |18-18| countries |17-17| . |19-19| 
 from |0-0| this |1-2| view |3-3| , |4-4| Germany |5-6| is |7-7| in |8-8| a far worse position |9-13| than the United States |14-18| . |19-19| 
 it must |0-1| deal with |2-3| neighbours |4-5| and |6-7| very diverse |9-10| opinions |8-8| , |11-11| and |12-12| it is not easy |13-17| . |18-18| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| the |3-3| United |8-8| States &apos; influence |4-7| on |9-9| European policy |10-12| is only |13-15| decrease , |16-17| but |18-18| at the moment |19-21| , |22-22| the EU |23-24| does not fill |25-27| this void |28-29| , |30-30| then who |31-32| is |33-33| ? |34-38|

 &quot; protection |0-1| of trademarks |2-3| in China |4-6| : when |7-8| Puma |9-9| and |10-10| Armani |11-11| suddenly |13-13| become |12-12| Chinese |14-14| 
 Armani and |0-1| Polo |2-2| Ralph |3-3| Lauren |4-4| are |5-6| known |8-8| brands |7-7| around the world |9-12| . |13-13| 
 Armani |0-0| Polo |1-1| ... |2-2| what is |3-6| it really |7-9| ? |10-10| 
 behind |0-0| the name |1-2| is |3-4| a registered trademark |5-7| officially |8-8| in China |9-10| , |11-11| but |12-12| that |13-13| has nothing to |14-17| do with |18-19| the |20-20| original |22-22| company |21-21| . |23-23| 
 the mark |0-1| enjoys |2-4| protection |5-6| as |7-8| the company |9-10| that |11-12| bears the name |13-15| cannot |16-17| complain |18-19| . |20-20| 
 and even |0-1| if it could , |2-6| it is not |7-10| sure |11-11| that it |12-13| would succeed |14-17| . |18-18| 
 &quot; |0-0| it is |1-2| increasingly |3-6| difficult for |7-8| foreigners |9-10| to protect |11-12| their brands |13-14| in China |15-16| , &quot; |17-18| said |19-19| Thomas |20-20| Pattloch |21-21| , a lawyer |22-23| of the |24-24| law firm |25-25| Taylor |26-26| Wessing |27-27| specializing |28-28| in violation |29-30| of the right |31-32| of ownership |33-34| in the Far East |35-38| . |39-39| 
 each |0-0| week , |1-2| a new |3-4| record |5-5| arrives |6-6| on |7-7| my desk |8-9| . |10-10| 
 imitators |0-1| need only |2-5| a few |6-7| extra letters |8-9| to be able to |10-11| register their |12-13| trademarks . |14-15| 
 thus , |0-1| instead |2-3| of |4-4| Gucci |5-5| , |6-8| Lu |9-9| @-@ |10-10| Gucci |11-11| , |12-12| and |13-13| instead |14-15| of |16-16| Prada |17-17| , |18-20| Prada |21-21| @-@ |22-22| Kny |23-23| . |24-24|

 Pattloch |0-0| opens |1-1| a filing cabinet |2-3| in which |4-7| the |8-8| recordings |9-10| to the |11-13| trademark office |14-16| in Beijing |17-18| . |19-19| 
 on September 14 , |0-2| 2010 |3-3| , |4-4| a |5-5| Chinese company |6-7| filed |8-9| the trademark |10-11| Zegna |12-12| DF |13-13| Puma |14-14| , |15-15| a name |16-17| that |18-18| the firm |19-20| has |21-21| artificially |22-22| created |23-23| by appropriating |24-26| part |27-28| of the |29-29| name of |30-31| Ermenegildo Zegna |32-33| , |34-34| the |35-35| fashion house |36-38| . |39-39| 
 it is a |0-2| known fact |3-4| that the Chinese |5-7| have become |8-9| the world champions |10-13| of the |14-15| copy |16-16| and |17-18| the violation |19-20| of |21-21| intellectual property . |22-25| 
 in large cities |0-3| , |4-4| there are |5-7| multi @-@ storey |10-12| shopping centres |8-9| that |13-14| sell |15-15| virtually |16-16| as |17-17| counterfeit . |18-20| 
 Pattloch |3-3| cases |0-2| , however , are |4-5| different |6-6| : |7-7| its constituents |8-9| the |10-10| responsibility |11-11| to address the |12-15| fact that |16-17| the |18-18| Chinese Trademark |20-22| Office |19-19| formally conferred |23-24| with |25-25| Chinese companies |26-27| the right |28-29| to use |30-31| a name that |32-34| is already |35-36| protected |37-37| in another country |38-41| . |42-42| 
 the Chinese |0-1| talk of |2-3| &quot; |4-4| Bang |5-5| Mingpai |6-6| , &quot; |7-8| parent |11-11| brand |9-10| . |12-12| 
 the term |0-1| is |2-2| derived from |3-4| &quot; |5-5| Bang |6-6| Dakuan |7-7| . &quot; |8-9| 
 it is with |0-2| this term |3-4| that |5-5| are designated |6-7| women |8-9| who |10-10| marry men |11-15| rich . |16-17| 
 the Chinese authorities |0-2| say they |3-3| have nothing to |4-7| hide |8-9| . |10-10| 
 &quot; it |0-1| is bad |2-3| for business |4-6| , we need to |7-9| combat |10-11| this trend |12-13| , &quot; |14-15| requires |16-16| Pattloch |17-17| . |18-18| 
 &quot; |0-0| the mark |1-2| is |3-3| watered down |4-4| , |5-5| the singularity |6-7| disappears , |8-9| the damage |10-11| to |12-12| the reputation |13-14| are enormous |15-16| . &quot; |17-18| 
 the |0-0| financial losses |1-2| and |3-3| legal costs |4-7| totalling millions |8-11| for |12-12| the sectors concerned |13-15| , especially |16-17| with regard to |18-21| the |22-22| expensive |25-25| flagship products |23-24| . |26-26| 
 according to |0-0| data from |1-3| the |4-4| market |8-9| analysis |7-7| firm |5-6| CLSA |10-10| , |11-11| China |12-13| represents |14-14| , |15-15| with |16-16| an annual volume |17-19| of |20-20| 15 |21-21| billion euros |22-24| , |25-25| the third |26-27| global market for |28-30| luxury goods |31-33| and |34-34| one that |35-36| is growing |37-38| most rapidly . |39-42| 
 however , |0-1| it is not |2-5| easy to |6-7| write off |8-8| questionable |11-11| registrations |9-10| in the |12-12| register of marks |13-15| and |16-16| these procedures |17-18| are expensive |19-20| . |21-21| 
 these can |0-2| last up |3-4| to nine |5-6| years |7-7| , |8-8| and |9-9| the outcome |10-11| is never |12-14| certain . |15-16| 
 Pattloch |0-0| reported |1-2| cases |3-4| in which |5-6| the court |7-8| rejected |9-10| the complaint |11-12| , because |13-14| after |15-15| a long period of time |16-18| , |19-19| the name |20-21| criticized |22-22| had become |23-24| a |25-25| &quot; |26-26| market reality |27-29| . &quot; |30-31| 
 Pattloch |0-0| tells us |1-2| that if |3-4| the complainant |5-6| has no |7-10| chance |11-11| , |12-12| it may |13-14| even be |15-16| obliged to |17-18| pay money |19-22| to |23-23| plagiaire |24-24| , because |25-26| it would have |27-28| damaged |29-30| its brand |31-32| in China |33-34| . |35-35| 
 in |0-0| this area |1-2| , |3-3| sometimes it is |4-6| the law |7-8| of |9-9| the jungle |10-11| that dominates |12-13| . |14-14| 
 the |0-0| famous |2-2| cases |1-1| also concern |3-4| graphic elements |5-7| . |8-8| 
 in 2009 |0-1| , Daimler |2-3| had lost |4-5| a legal battle |6-8| against |9-9| the |10-10| construction |14-15| machinery |13-13| manufacturer |11-12| Sany |16-16| , |17-17| the same |18-19| company that |20-21| had |22-22| to buy |23-24| the producer |25-26| of |27-27| Putzmeister |31-31| concrete |30-30| pumps |28-29| . |32-32| 
 that is |0-1| the reason why |2-5| the Chinese |6-7| can use |8-9| an emblem |10-11| that |12-12| resembles |13-14| the |15-15| Mercedes |17-17| star |16-16| . |18-18| 
 Bing |0-0| , |1-1| the |2-2| Volvo |4-5| logger |3-3| , |6-6| used |7-7| before |8-8| a |9-9| blue |11-11| @-@ and @-@ white |12-13| logo |10-10| reminiscent of |14-15| that of |16-17| BMW |18-18| . |19-19| the conflict |20-21| was |22-22| settled |23-23| and |24-24| Bing |25-25| had to |26-26| change it |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the |0-0| fashion house |1-3| Lacoste |4-4| had lost |5-6| against |7-8| plagiarize |9-9| from |10-10| Hong Kong |11-12| and Singapore |13-15| who had |16-17| redirected |18-18| the gaze |19-20| of the famous |21-22| crocodile |23-23| in |24-24| the |25-25| opposite direction |26-27| . |28-28| 
 according to |0-0| the Chinese authorities |1-3| , |4-4| they |5-6| are guilty |7-8| of |9-9| anything . |10-11| 
 the |0-0| CTMO |4-4| Trademark Office |1-3| in Beijing |5-6| admits |7-7| , however , have |8-9| experienced |10-10| some difficulties |11-12| in 2010 |13-14| because |15-16| of a |17-18| lack of staff |19-21| and space |22-24| . |25-25| 
 however , |0-1| the Office |2-3| would be |4-4| spent |5-5| last year |6-8| of an |9-10| &quot; |11-11| emergency situation |12-14| in the |15-16| conduct of the |17-18| work to |19-20| a |21-21| newfound |23-23| normality |22-22| . &quot; |24-25| 
 for example , |0-1| the number |2-3| of |4-4| untreated |8-9| opposition procedures |5-7| would have |10-10| fallen by |11-12| 22 |13-13| % |14-14| . |15-15| 
 nearly |0-1| 57,000 |2-2| cases of |3-4| this type |5-6| would have been |7-8| closed |9-9| , |10-10| which represents |11-13| an increase |14-15| of |16-16| 75 |17-17| per cent |18-18| compared |19-20| to |21-21| the previous year |22-24| . |25-25| 
 nevertheless , |0-1| 81,500 |2-2| procedures |3-3| remain |4-4| outstanding |5-6| at |7-7| the office |8-9| . |10-10| 
 act |0-0| is expensive |1-2| 
 as is often the case |0-1| in China |2-3| , |4-4| the |5-5| numbers are impressive |6-8| . |9-9| 
 last year |0-2| , the |3-4| CTMO |5-5| received more than |6-9| 1.4 million |10-12| applications for |13-14| trademark |15-17| , |18-18| almost |19-19| a third |20-21| more than in |22-25| 2010 |26-26| . |27-27| 
 according to |0-0| the Office |1-2| , it |3-4| is a record |5-9| , and |10-10| this means |11-12| that |13-13| China |14-15| is |16-17| for the |18-19| 10th |20-20| consecutive time |21-22| at the top |23-24| of the |25-25| rankings for |26-27| the number |28-29| of new |30-31| deposits in |32-33| the world |34-35| . |36-36| 
 this also would be true |0-2| for the |3-4| total number |5-6| of |7-7| legal |9-9| brands |8-8| , which |10-11| is 5.5 |12-14| million |15-15| . |16-16| 
 in 2011 |0-1| , |2-2| the Office |3-4| would have |5-5| accounted for |6-6| 1.8 billion |7-8| yuan |9-10| of |11-11| registration fee |12-14| . |15-15| 
 in other words |0-3| , |4-4| each recording |5-6| reported |7-8| an average |9-10| 1,280 |11-11| yuan , |12-13| or |14-14| 160 |15-15| euros |16-16| . |17-17| 
 a legal battle |0-2| is |3-3| far more |4-5| , |6-6| as illustrated by |7-9| the case |10-11| of the |12-13| German |16-16| family firm |14-15| Freudenberg |17-17| . |18-18| 
 for more than |0-2| seven years |3-4| , |5-5| the company |6-7| is fighting |8-9| against |10-10| a |11-11| Chinese |13-13| plagiaire |12-12| . |14-14| 
 certainly , |0-1| the Germans |2-3| were able to |4-5| obtain |6-6| the illegal manufacture of |7-11| vehicle |13-14| components |12-12| to be |15-15| suspended |16-16| . |17-17| 
 however , |0-1| the |2-2| imitator |3-3| was able to |4-5| maintain |6-6| its |7-7| Chinese |9-9| rights |8-8| on |10-10| the mark |11-12| Freudenberg |13-13| . |14-14| 
 &quot; it |0-1| is |2-2| our fault |3-4| , because |5-6| the |7-7| family names |8-10| cannot |11-13| be protected |14-15| in Germany |16-17| , &quot; |18-19| said |20-20| Hanno |21-21| Wentzler |22-22| , |23-23| president of |24-25| the direction |26-27| of |28-28| Freudenberg |29-29| Chemical Specialities |30-31| in Munich |32-33| . |34-34| 
 the Trademark Office had |0-4| therefore |5-5| dismissed |6-6| the objection |7-8| of |9-9| Munich |10-10| . |11-11| 
 Freudenberg |0-0| has certainly |1-2| been successful |3-6| with the |7-8| two |9-9| following |11-11| bodies |10-10| , |12-12| but |13-13| the |14-14| opposing party |15-16| continues |17-17| to fight |18-20| until |21-22| today |23-24| . |25-25| 
 the vigilance |0-1| is |2-4| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| the case |3-4| is pending |5-7| before the |8-10| Supreme Court |11-12| . |13-13| 
 Wentzler |0-0| is confident |1-2| , |3-3| he |4-4| believes in |5-6| a |7-7| positive outcome |8-9| of the trial |10-11| and |12-12| praising the professionalism |13-15| of judges |16-17| . |18-18| 
 however , |0-1| he added |2-3| : |4-4| &quot; |5-5| the process |6-7| is |8-8| long , hard and |9-12| costs us |13-14| a lot |15-15| of time and money |16-20| . &quot; |21-22| 
 it |0-0| is also |1-2| difficult to |3-4| assess |5-5| the internal costs |6-8| . |9-9| the |10-10| archives |11-13| has |14-14| even had to |15-16| review |17-19| the actions |20-21| of the |22-22| last hundred |23-24| years |25-25| to |26-27| provide evidence |28-30| . |31-31| 
 five years ago |0-4| , |5-5| Freudenberg |6-6| had |7-7| even proposed |8-9| in vain |10-11| to the |12-13| opposing party |14-15| a |16-16| &quot; |17-17| large sum |18-19| in euros |20-21| to six |22-23| figures |24-24| &quot; |25-25| to resolve |26-27| the dispute |28-29| . |30-30| 
 &quot; this |0-1| is what |2-5| we see |6-7| what it means |8-11| for us |12-13| , &quot; says |14-16| Wentzler |17-17| . |18-18| 
 the dangers |0-1| of |2-2| the Far |3-4| East |5-6| even threaten to |7-9| spill over |10-10| into Europe |11-13| . |14-14| 
 this |0-0| would be |1-1| the case |2-3| if |4-4| imitators |5-6| of |7-7| this region |8-9| ensured |10-11| the exploitation of |12-14| unprotected |16-17| marks |15-15| . |18-18| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| a Chinese producer |3-5| wanted to |6-6| testify |7-7| in Germany on |8-10| behalf of |11-12| Freudenberg |13-13| for |14-14| a production company |15-18| of |19-19| footwear and |20-22| leather |23-23| . |24-24| 
 the company had |0-2| long since abandoned |3-5| this sector |6-7| , |8-8| but it |9-10| could |11-12| still |13-14| prevent |15-15| the deposit |16-17| . |18-18| 
 Wentzler |0-0| adds |1-1| : |2-2| &quot; |3-3| vigilance |4-5| is required |6-8| . &quot; |9-10| 
 Pattloch |0-0| and |1-1| advise |3-3| him |2-2| to the |4-4| German companies |5-6| to exercise |7-10| great caution |11-13| in their |14-15| trade relations |16-17| with China |18-20| . |21-21| 
 it is not enough |0-3| , |4-4| according to them |5-6| , |7-7| to rely on |8-11| international trademark law |12-15| , foreigners |16-18| should instead |19-20| &quot; |21-21| recording |22-23| China |24-25| everything that |26-28| is likely to |29-31| be protected |32-33| , &quot; |34-35| in the words of |36-38| Wentzler |39-39| . |40-40| 
 otherwise , |0-1| the costs |2-3| can be |4-5| much more |6-7| important than |8-9| those of |10-11| the recording |12-13| . |14-14| 
 indeed |0-1| , |2-2| if |3-3| Freudenberg |4-4| lost |5-5| the battle |6-7| in the last |8-10| act of |11-12| his |13-13| legal |15-15| drama |14-14| , |16-16| the company |17-18| should |19-19| pay |20-21| licensing fees |22-24| to the |25-26| opposing party |27-28| for |29-29| the use |30-31| of its |32-33| own name |34-35| , |36-36| as explained |37-39| Wentzler |40-40| . |41-41| 
 or , |0-2| we would lose |3-4| our place |5-6| on |7-7| the market segment |8-11| in question |12-13| . |14-14|

 facts |0-0| about |1-3| sexually transmitted |5-6| infections |4-4| 
 what are the |0-2| most common |6-8| sexually transmitted |4-5| diseases |3-3| ? |9-9| 
 among the |0-1| bacterial STIs |2-3| , |4-6| syphilis |7-8| , |9-10| and |12-12| gonorrhea |13-14| chlamydiées |11-11| ( |15-15| or |16-16| gonorrhea ) |17-18| . |19-19| 
 common |2-2| STIs |0-1| are |3-3| HIV |4-5| , the |6-7| human papilloma |9-11| virus |8-8| , |12-12| genital herpes |13-15| or |16-16| hepatitis |17-18| . |19-19| 
 the |0-0| pubic lice |1-3| and |4-4| scabies |5-6| belong |7-7| to STIs |8-9| . |10-11| 
 what are the |0-2| main |4-4| groups |3-3| concerned |5-5| ? |6-6| 
 syphilis |0-1| and |2-2| gonorrhea |3-4| often appear |5-6| in men |7-9| who |10-10| have sex |11-14| with other |15-17| men |18-18| . |19-19| 
 the |0-0| Robert |2-2| @-@ |3-3| Koch |4-4| Institute |1-1| estimates that |5-6| sexual contact |7-9| between men |10-11| are at the root |12-15| of at |16-17| least four |18-19| out of five |23-24| syphilis cases |20-22| reported |25-25| in Germany |26-27| . |28-28| 
 among |0-0| heterosexual |3-3| adults |1-2| , |4-4| chlamydiées |9-9| related |7-8| infections |5-6| , |10-10| trichomoniasis |11-12| , candidiasis |13-15| ( |16-16| fungal ) |17-18| , |19-19| gonorrhea and |20-22| human papilloma virus |23-27| are |28-29| common sexually transmitted diseases |30-33| . |34-34| 
 the rate |0-1| of |2-2| spread of HIV |3-5| among |6-6| heterosexual |8-8| adults |7-7| is relatively low |9-11| in Germany |12-13| . |14-14| however , |15-16| some 20 |17-18| % of |19-20| new HIV infections |21-24| are occurring |25-26| within |27-29| this group |30-31| . |32-32| 
 among young people |0-2| , |3-3| there is |4-5| a rate |6-7| of infections |8-9| linked to |10-11| chlamydiées |12-12| significantly higher |13-15| than among |16-17| other |18-19| population groups |20-22| . |23-23| 
 according to |0-1| EU |4-4| surveys |2-3| , three @-@ quarters |5-8| of all infections are among |9-13| young people |14-15| aged |16-17| 15 |18-18| to 25 |19-20| years |21-21| . |22-22| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| in Germany |3-4| , the |5-6| human papilloma |8-10| virus |7-7| is common |11-12| among young people |13-15| . |16-16| 
 what is |0-1| the change in the number |2-5| of infections |6-7| ? |8-8| 
 it is not required |0-4| to declare |5-6| all |7-8| sexually transmitted |10-11| diseases |9-9| . |12-12| 
 according to |0-0| the |1-1| Robert Koch |3-5| Institute |2-2| , |6-6| the number |7-8| of cases |9-10| of syphilis |11-12| has more |13-14| than doubled |15-16| in |17-17| 10 |18-18| years |19-19| : |20-20| the figure |21-22| rose from |23-25| 1,967 |26-26| in 2001 |27-28| to |29-29| 3,698 |30-30| in 2011 |31-32| . |33-33| 
 since 2007 |0-1| , |2-2| the number |3-4| of new HIV infections |5-9| is |10-10| . |11-11| 
 in 2011 |0-1| , |2-2| there were |3-6| approximately |7-7| 2,700 |8-8| cases |9-9| . |10-10| 
 this represents |0-1| a decline |2-3| of a |4-5| tenth |6-6| compared |7-8| to |9-9| the previous year |10-12| . |13-13| 
 what are |0-1| the symptoms |2-3| of a |4-5| sexual |7-7| disease |6-6| ? |8-8| 
 infectious diseases |0-2| can cause |3-4| abscesses |5-6| genital |7-11| and |12-13| urinary |15-15| pain |14-14| , |16-16| loss of |17-18| white , |19-20| pain |21-22| in the lower abdomen |23-26| , as well as |27-28| the emergence |29-30| of |31-31| buttons |32-32| and |33-34| warts |35-35| . |36-36| 
 however , |0-1| they do |2-4| regularly |5-5| no |6-6| pain |7-7| or |8-8| other symptoms |9-10| , and |11-11| therefore remain |12-13| hidden . |14-15| 
 how to protect themselves |0-2| ? |3-3| 
 condoms can |0-2| reduce |3-3| the risk |4-5| of infection |6-7| , |8-8| but |9-9| they |10-10| do not protect |11-13| 100 |14-15| % |16-16| . |17-17| 
 the reason is |0-3| that the pathogens |4-7| of |8-8| sexually transmitted |10-11| diseases |9-9| can also |12-13| be transmitted |14-15| by |16-16| lubricating |18-18| infection |17-17| or |19-21| close |24-24| body contact |22-23| . |25-25| 
 the experts |0-1| therefore recommend |2-3| to |4-4| anyone |5-6| often |8-9| changing |7-7| sexual partners |10-11| to |12-13| regular |14-15| examinations . |16-17| 
 most |0-2| STIs |3-3| quickly |4-4| detected |5-5| can be |6-7| cured |8-8| and |9-9| the |10-10| late sequelae |11-12| can |13-13| be avoided |14-15| . |16-16| 
 thanks to the |0-1| sponsorships |2-2| , |3-3| donations |4-5| , |6-6| but above all |7-8| to the funds |9-10| that |11-11| are reaping the |12-13| choristers |14-14| through |15-16| their voices |17-18| across |19-20| Germany |21-22| , |23-24| can |25-26| accumulate |27-28| . |29-29| 
 &quot; |0-0| in |1-1| all , |2-3| we have |4-5| already sent |6-7| about |8-8| 200,000 |9-9| euros |10-10| in |11-11| eSitjeni |12-12| , &quot; says |13-15| Annette |16-16| Lennartz , |17-18| president of |19-20| the association |21-22| . |23-23| 
 in the village |0-1| , |2-2| Zodwa |3-3| Dlamini , |4-5| a |6-6| confident |8-10| woman |7-7| and |11-11| who |12-12| always gets |13-14| what it wants |15-18| , |19-19| manages |20-20| money |21-22| from |23-25| Germany |26-27| . |28-28| 
 it |0-0| also ensures |1-4| that |5-5| orphans |6-7| are well |8-9| housed |10-10| in |11-12| one |13-13| of their |14-15| grandmothers |16-18| , for example |19-20| . |21-21| 
 the victims |0-1| , |2-2| it &apos;s |3-4| so |5-5| @-@ called |6-9| old women |10-11| in Zulu |12-13| , |14-14| are the |15-16| pillars of the |17-18| village . |19-20| 
 some of them |0-3| are |4-4| up to |5-6| 14 |7-7| orphans |8-8| , |9-9| they |10-11| offer |12-12| a roof |13-14| and ensure |15-18| that |19-19| they go |20-22| every day |23-24| at |25-25| the time |26-27| at school |28-30| in their |31-32| uniforms . |33-34| 
 the orphan |0-1| who |2-2| did |3-4| no one |5-6| is allowed |7-8| in a |9-10| safe place |11-12| , |13-13| in |14-14| Khanyisile |15-15| , |16-16| a woman |17-18| who |19-19| lives alone |20-21| and |22-22| is paid |23-24| by |25-25| the association |26-27| , |28-28| just as |29-30| the two |31-32| cooks |33-33| prepare |34-35| meals |38-39| every day |36-37| for |40-40| more than |41-42| 200 |43-43| hungry children |44-45| . |46-46| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| &quot; |3-3| Voices |4-4| for Africa |5-6| &quot; |7-7| has created |8-9| a school |10-11| of |12-12| couture |13-13| and |14-14| allowed |15-15| the construction |16-17| of two |18-19| barns |20-20| . |21-21| with the support |22-24| of the |25-26| American |28-28| health |29-31| organization |27-27| PSI |32-32| , |33-33| the association |34-35| hosted |36-37| an |38-38| HIV test |39-43| for |44-44| many |45-46| people . |47-48| 
 this |0-0| cannot be taken for granted |1-5| , |6-6| because even |7-8| if |9-9| the disease |10-11| is |12-12| clearly visible |13-14| throughout the country |15-18| , |19-19| it |20-20| is still a |21-22| taboo subject |23-24| . |25-25| 
 a |0-0| king and |1-2| his 14 |3-4| wives |5-5| 
 &quot; |0-0| AIDS |1-2| is |3-3| a real |4-5| taboo |6-6| , &quot; |7-8| says |9-9| Annette |10-10| Lennartz , |11-12| &quot; |13-13| because it is |14-16| an issue |17-18| that affects |19-20| sexuality |21-22| . &quot; |23-24| 
 it is |0-1| curious |2-3| , |4-4| coming from |5-6| a country where |7-9| the king |10-11| has |12-12| 14 |13-13| official |15-15| wives |14-14| . |16-16| 
 the |0-0| Africa &apos;s |4-6| last |1-1| absolute monarch |2-3| , |7-8| King Mswati |9-11| III |12-12| , |13-13| is |14-14| known for his |15-17| excessive |21-21| lifestyle |18-20| . |22-22| 
 polygamy |0-1| in place of |2-5| democracy |6-7| . |8-8| 
 these |0-0| mores |1-1| sanctioned by |2-3| the State |4-5| , |6-6| among others |7-8| , |9-9| are responsible for |10-12| the |13-13| rapid spread |14-15| of HIV |16-17| observed |18-18| in recent |19-20| decades |21-21| . |22-22| 
 migrant workers |0-2| have also |3-4| spread |5-5| the virus |6-7| across |8-9| the country |10-11| . |12-12| 
 yet |2-2| condoms |3-4| are found |0-1| on every street corner |5-9| , &quot; adds |10-11| Annette |12-12| Lennartz , |13-14| &quot; |15-15| but almost |16-17| nobody |18-19| uses them . |20-22|

 in order to |0-1| foster |2-2| some |3-4| cultural exchange |5-7| , |8-8| the |9-9| choristers |10-10| of |11-11| Imbongi |12-12| leave |13-13| together |14-14| on a trip |15-16| every two or |17-20| three years |21-22| in southern |23-26| Africa |27-28| and sing songs |29-32| filled with |33-34| nostalgia |35-35| , courage |36-38| , confidence |39-41| and |42-42| black |45-45| identity |43-44| that many |46-47| people |48-49| from the |50-51| tip of the |52-53| black continent |54-55| still know |56-57| the time |58-59| of |60-60| apartheid |61-62| . |63-63| 
 the bus |0-1| filled with |2-3| white people |4-4| who |5-5| sing |6-6| in |7-7| African language |8-9| is |10-10| a sign |11-12| of recognition |13-14| as it |15-17| creates |18-18| not only |19-20| good humour |21-22| and |23-23| joy |24-24| , |25-25| but |26-26| hard |27-27| sometimes |28-29| a tear |30-31| to |32-32| some |33-33| formidable |34-34| border guards |35-37| . |38-38| 
 the bus |0-1| takes them |2-3| still in |4-5| eSitjeni |6-6| , |7-7| where the |8-9| choristers |10-10| visit their |11-14| godchildren |15-15| . |16-16| 
 although it |0-2| is difficult |3-4| to find |5-6| the |7-7| small village |8-9| on a map |10-12| , |13-13| eSitjeni |14-14| is well known |15-17| in |18-18| the valley |19-20| of the |21-22| Ezulweni |23-23| . |24-24|

 Messenger |0-0| : |1-1| NASA |2-3| discovers |4-4| the presence |5-6| of ice |7-8| on Mercury |9-10| 
 the probe |0-1| Messenger |2-2| reported |3-4| evidence |5-6| of |7-7| the existence |8-9| of ice |10-11| on |12-12| the planet |13-14| Mercury . |15-16| 
 the |0-0| ice |2-3| layer |1-1| could reach |4-5| 20 |6-6| metres |7-7| thick |8-9| . |10-10| 
 the US space agency NASA |0-4| has proved |5-6| the existence |7-8| of ice |9-10| on |11-11| the planet |12-13| Mercury . |14-15| 
 although |0-1| this |2-2| is |4-4| the |5-5| closest |6-7| planet |3-3| to the Sun |8-9| , |10-10| it |11-11| contains |12-13| frozen water |14-16| , |17-17| as explained in |18-20| three |21-21| studies published |22-23| Thursday |24-25| in |26-26| the |27-27| journal |28-29| &quot; Science |30-31| . &quot; |32-33| 
 the probe |0-1| Messenger |2-2| reported |3-4| evidence |5-6| of |7-7| the existence |8-9| of an |10-11| ice cover |12-14| in |15-15| the region |16-17| of |18-18| the world |19-20| permanently |21-22| immersed in |23-24| the shadows |25-26| . |27-27| 
 this coverage |0-1| would have |2-2| a thickness |3-4| of at |5-6| least 30 |7-8| centimetres |9-9| of up to |10-13| 20 |14-14| metres |15-15| . |16-16| 
 the water |0-1| is probably derived from |2-4| comets |5-5| or |6-9| asteroids |10-11| that would |12-13| hit |14-14| Mercury . |15-16| 
 however , |0-1| no |2-4| link |5-6| between |7-7| the discovery |8-9| of water |10-11| and |12-12| the assumption |13-14| of a |15-16| presence |17-17| of life |18-19| on |20-20| the planet |21-22| , &quot; says |23-24| the |25-25| chief scientist |26-28| of |29-29| the probe |30-31| Messenger , |32-33| Sean |34-34| Solomon |35-35| . |36-36| 
 the temperature |0-1| on Mercury |2-3| can reach |4-5| 426 |6-6| degrees Celsius |7-8| . |9-9| 
 the discovery |0-1| could help |2-3| in understanding |4-5| how |6-6| water and |7-9| other |10-11| essential elements |12-13| to life |14-16| arrived |17-18| in other |19-21| parts of the |22-23| solar system |24-25| . |26-26|

 this detail |0-1| of an |2-3| infrared photograph |4-5| taken by |6-7| the |8-8| Spitzer |10-10| telescope |9-9| shows |11-11| a |12-12| &quot; |13-13| family portrait |14-16| &quot; |17-17| of the countless |18-19| generations |20-20| of stars |21-22| : |23-23| the |24-24| oldest |25-26| stars |27-27| are |28-28| blue |29-30| and |31-32| pink |34-34| points |33-33| , |35-35| more difficult to |36-38| identify , |39-40| are the |41-42| &quot; |43-43| new |44-44| @-@ |45-45| born |46-46| &quot; in |47-48| the |49-49| delivery room |50-52| of |53-53| the universe |54-55| . |56-56| 
 the |0-0| Spitzer |2-2| telescope |1-1| discovered |3-4| this region |5-6| where |7-7| stars are born |8-10| , called |11-12| &quot; |13-13| W5 |14-14| , &quot; |15-16| a |17-17| little |19-20| romantic |21-21| name |18-18| , |22-22| in |23-23| the |24-24| constellation of |25-26| Cassiopeia |27-27| , |28-29| 6,500 |30-30| light @-@ years |31-33| . |34-34| 
 the |0-0| NASA Spitzer |2-5| telescope |1-1| photographed |6-7| the |8-8| flamboyant |10-10| brilliance |9-9| of a |11-12| dying |14-17| star |13-13| . |18-18| 
 the |0-0| doughnut @-@ shaped |2-5| circle |1-1| is composed |6-7| of elements |8-9| that |10-10| the star |11-12| plans |13-13| when she |14-15| dies |16-16| . |17-17|

 the |0-0| Spitzer |2-2| telescope |1-1| photographed |3-4| this |5-5| galactic |9-9| birthing room |6-8| . |10-10| 
 the Pleiades |0-2| star cluster |3-5| also called |6-7| the &quot; |8-9| seven |10-10| sisters |11-11| , &quot; |12-13| can be |14-15| seen |16-16| with the naked eye |17-20| during |21-21| the night |22-23| . |24-24| 
 however , |0-1| the telescope |2-3| is |4-4| more |5-5| colors |6-7| . |8-10| 
 in this photo |0-2| infrared |3-3| , |4-4| the |5-5| Helix |8-8| Nebula |6-7| , such as |9-10| a |11-11| red |13-13| eye |12-12| , |14-14| looks |15-15| directly at the viewer |16-18| . |19-19| 
 it |0-0| is 700 |1-4| light years away |5-7| in |8-8| the constellation |9-10| of Aquarius |11-12| . |13-13| 
 its |0-0| similarities |1-1| with |2-2| a |3-3| land |5-5| continent |4-4| earned him |6-8| the title |9-10| of |11-11| North America |12-14| . |15-15| 
 the combination |0-1| of the |2-3| normal |5-5| photo |4-4| and |6-8| infrared |10-10| photo |9-9| shows |11-13| a |14-14| dramatic |16-16| hue |15-15| . |17-17| 
 only the |0-1| Spitzer |6-6| telescope |5-5| &apos;s infrared |3-4| detectors |2-2| were able to |7-8| capture |9-9| an image |10-11| of the |12-13| new star |14-15| in all its beauty |16-19| . |20-20| 
 one of the |0-1| greatest |2-3| mysteries in |4-5| astronomy |6-7| is the creation |8-11| of the rings |12-13| of |14-14| Saturn |15-15| . |16-16| 
 one theory |0-1| is that |2-3| the rings |4-5| are |6-6| the remains |7-8| of a |9-10| moon |11-11| of |12-12| Saturn |13-13| that |14-14| disappeared |15-19| 4.5 |20-20| billion years |21-23| without a trace |24-27| . |28-28| 
 one of |0-2| the |3-3| largest and most |4-8| net |9-9| that |10-10| has |11-11| taken |12-12| the |13-13| Hubble Space Telescope |14-15| is one |16-17| of the |18-19| stars in globular |20-22| . |23-23| 
 depending on |0-0| the hue |1-2| , |3-3| the photographs |4-5| of |6-6| spiral galaxies |7-8| can become |9-10| real |11-12| works of |13-14| art . |15-15| 
 the |0-0| photograph |1-1| published |2-2| by |3-3| the |4-4| European Southern |6-7| Observatory |5-5| shows |8-8| the |9-9| nebula |10-11| in |13-13| the constellation |14-15| of Sagittarius |16-17| Trifide |12-12| , |18-19| several thousand |20-21| light @-@ years |22-25| . |26-26| 
 the name |0-2| comes from the |4-5| Latin word |6-7| &quot; |8-8| Trifide |3-3| trifidus |9-9| &quot; ( |10-11| divided |12-12| , |13-13| divided |14-14| into three |15-16| ) |17-17| , because |18-19| three |20-20| streaks |21-21| of dust |22-23| divide the |24-25| gleaming |27-27| heart |26-26| of the |28-28| birthplace |29-31| of stars |32-33| . |34-34| 
 astronomers have |0-2| photographed |3-3| the beginnings |4-5| of a |6-7| cosmic |9-9| pileup |8-8| in |10-10| the constellation |11-13| Ophiuchus |14-14| : |15-15| 400 |16-17| million light @-@ years |18-22| from Earth |23-25| , |26-26| the nuclei |27-28| of two |29-30| galaxies |31-31| in |32-32| merger |33-33| rush |34-35| towards each other |36-40| , |41-41| the collision |42-43| is inevitable |44-45| . |46-46| 
 the |0-0| Hubble telescope |1-2| has |3-3| observed |4-4| the birth |5-6| of these |7-8| stars |9-9| in |10-10| the |11-11| spiral galaxy |12-13| M83 |14-14| . |15-15| 
 if you don &apos;t like |0-4| the |5-5| technical |7-7| abbreviations |6-6| , |8-8| you can |9-10| use his |11-12| nickname |13-13| of |14-14| &quot; |15-15| Southern |19-19| wheel of fire |16-18| . &quot; |20-21| 
 the photo |0-1| of the |2-2| Hubble Space Telescope |3-5| shows |6-6| a detail |7-8| of |9-9| the nebula |10-11| of |12-12| Iris |13-14| , |15-15| in |16-16| the constellation |17-19| Cepheus |20-20| . |21-21| 
 the nebula |0-1| is located |2-3| at |4-4| 1,400 |5-5| light @-@ years |6-8| and |9-9| is |10-10| made up of |11-12| dust |14-15| grains |13-13| that are |16-17| 10 to |18-19| 100 times |20-21| smaller than |22-24| current |28-28| household dust |25-27| . |29-29| 
 this photo was |0-3| developed from the |4-7| X @-@ ray |11-11| and optical |9-10| images |8-8| taken |12-12| by different |13-14| telescopes |15-15| . |16-16| 
 you can |0-2| see |3-3| the circle |4-5| consisting |6-6| of |7-7| black holes |8-9| found |10-12| at |13-13| 430 |14-14| million light @-@ years |15-19| from Earth |20-22| . |23-23| 
 the |0-0| space telescope |1-2| photographed |3-4| for |5-5| NASA |6-7| this group |8-9| of |10-10| galaxies |11-11| called |12-12| Arp |13-13| 273 |14-14| . |15-15| 
 scientists have |0-2| named |3-3| the largest |4-6| spiral galaxy |7-8| &quot; |9-9| GC |10-10| 1810 |11-11| . &quot; |12-13| 
 in |0-0| this |1-1| nebula |2-2| is |3-4| the |5-5| group of |6-7| the |10-10| brightest |11-12| young |9-9| stars |8-8| in our |13-14| Milky Way |15-16| . |17-17| 
 the |0-0| heavenly |2-2| cradle |1-1| always gives |3-4| rise to new |5-8| stars . |9-10| 
 these clouds |0-1| of stars |2-3| , |4-4| which are |5-6| connected by |7-8| the Rosetta Nebula |9-13| , |14-14| also create |15-16| permanently |17-18| young |19-20| stars |21-21| to |22-22| 5,000 |23-23| light @-@ years |24-26| from Earth |27-29| . |30-30| 
 in |0-0| this |1-1| galaxy |2-2| to light rays and |3-6| breakthrough |7-7| of a small |8-10| black hole |11-12| , |13-13| there is still no |14-18| dust |19-20| , |21-21| there is |22-25| that |26-26| gas . |27-29| 
 scientists believe |0-2| that he |3-4| was born |5-6| shortly after |7-8| the |9-9| no Big Bang |10-10| , |11-11| when |12-12| the universe |13-14| was composed |15-16| largely |17-19| of hydrogen |20-21| . |22-22| 
 our view of |0-2| the universe |3-4| : |5-5| the major |6-7| telescopes |8-8| 
 the telescope |0-1| was |2-3| invented |4-4| in 1608 |5-6| by |7-7| Hans |8-8| Lipperhey , |9-10| before |11-12| Galileo |13-13| did |14-15| use |16-16| a year later |17-20| to observe |21-22| the stars |23-24| . |25-25| 
 since then , |0-1| the mirrors |2-3| optical telescopes |4-6| have not |7-9| ceased |10-10| to grow |11-12| and |13-13| thanks to them |14-16| , it |17-18| was |19-20| possible to |21-22| see |23-23| deeper |24-26| in |27-27| the universe |28-29| . |30-30| 
 for 30 |0-1| years |2-2| , |3-3| between |4-4| 1947 |5-5| and |6-6| 1975 |7-7| , the |8-9| Hale |11-11| Telescope |10-10| on |12-12| Mount |15-16| Palomar |17-17| Observatory |13-14| near |18-19| San |20-20| Diego |21-21| was the |22-23| largest telescope |24-26| in the world |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the mirror |0-1| on |2-2| this image |3-4| had |5-5| a diameter |6-7| of five |8-9| metres |10-10| . |11-11| 
 in |0-0| Arizona |1-2| , |3-3| the United States |4-7| , |8-8| is |9-10| the |11-11| Large |12-12| Binocular |13-13| Telescope |14-14| . |15-15| 
 it |0-0| allows us |1-1| to observe |2-3| the universe |4-5| through |6-7| two |8-8| mirrors |9-9| , each with |10-11| a diameter |12-13| of |14-14| 8.4 |15-15| metres |16-16| . |17-17| 
 the belly |0-1| of |2-2| the Great Canary Telescope |3-5| at La |6-7| Palma in the |8-10| Canary Islands |11-12| , |13-13| is immense |14-15| . |16-16| the mirror |17-18| alone |19-21| reached |22-22| 10.4 |26-26| meters |27-27| in diameter |23-25| . |28-28| 
 the mirror |0-1| of the |2-2| Southern African |3-4| Large |5-5| Telescope |6-6| in South Africa |7-10| has |11-11| been segmented |12-13| in order to |14-15| make savings |16-18| . |19-19| 
 the diameter |0-1| still reaches |2-5| about |6-6| 11 |7-7| metres |8-8| . |9-9| 
 the downside |0-1| of the |2-3| economic |7-7| construction |5-6| method |4-4| is |8-8| that the |9-10| telescope |11-11| is set |12-13| at the level |14-15| of the |16-17| vertical angle |18-19| , |20-20| which limits |21-24| mobility |25-26| . |27-27| 
 the |0-0| Hobby |2-2| @-@ |3-3| Eberly |4-4| telescope |1-1| in Texas |5-6| is |7-7| also |8-9| set |10-10| at the level |11-12| of the |13-14| vertical angle |15-16| . |17-17| 
 its |0-0| particularity |1-1| lies in |2-3| its great |4-5| ability to |6-7| collect |8-9| light |10-10| . |11-11| 
 despite |0-0| a |1-1| relatively small |5-6| diameter |2-3| mirror |4-4| , |7-7| this capacity |8-9| is close to |10-12| those of the |13-14| largest telescopes |15-17| in |18-18| the world &apos;s |20-21| mirror |19-19| . |22-22|

 thanks to |0-1| a total |2-3| of four |4-5| mirrors , |6-7| this telescope |8-9| can |10-10| illuminate |11-11| the |12-12| infrared spectrum |13-14| . |15-16| 
 the construction |0-1| of a |2-3| European |7-7| Very Large Telescope |4-6| ( European |8-9| Extremely |10-10| Large Telescope ) |11-13| is also |14-15| planned for |16-17| the site |18-19| of ESO |20-22| in Chile |23-24| . |25-25| 
 its |0-0| main mirror |1-2| is expected to reach |3-4| the |5-5| impressive size |6-7| of |8-8| 42 |9-9| metres |10-10| . |11-11| it will be composed of |12-15| nearly |16-17| 1,000 |18-18| elements of |19-20| mirrors . |21-22| 
 however , |0-1| the telescope |2-3| will not |4-5| take photographs |6-8| before |9-9| 2018 |10-10| at the earliest |11-13| . |14-14| 
 until 2007 |0-2| , |3-3| the two |4-5| Keck |8-8| telescopes |6-7| on the |9-10| Hawaiian |12-12| volcano |11-11| of Mauna Kea |13-15| were considered the |16-19| biggest |20-21| in the world |22-23| . |24-24| 
 they |0-0| wore |1-1| two |2-2| mirrors |3-3| with a diameter |4-6| of |7-7| 10 |8-8| metres |9-9| each . |10-11| 
 the |0-0| Keck |3-3| telescopes |1-2| are part |4-5| of the |6-7| Mauna Kea |10-11| Observatory |8-9| who |12-12| observed |13-13| the sky |14-15| with the |16-17| Subaru |19-19| Telescope |18-18| and |20-21| FTIR |22-22| . |23-23| 
 a new |0-1| giant |3-3| telescope |2-2| should also |4-5| be |6-6| constructed |7-7| on |8-8| Mauna |9-10| Kea |11-11| and |12-12| the diameter |13-14| of its |15-16| mirror |17-17| will reach |18-18| 30 |19-19| metres |20-20| . |21-21|

 however , |0-1| no reliable data |2-4| on |5-5| this theory |6-7| exists |8-9| because |10-11| Messenger |12-12| orbit |13-13| much |14-14| closer to the |15-17| North Pole |18-19| on Mercury . |20-22| 
 the |0-0| radar |2-2| data |1-1| indicated |3-3| for decades |4-6| the presence |7-8| of ice |9-10| on Mercury |11-12| . |13-13| 
 thanks to the |0-1| launch of |2-3| the probe |4-5| Messenger |6-6| in 2004 |7-8| , |9-9| the first |10-11| to |12-12| orbit |13-15| Mercury , |16-17| scientists |18-19| now have |20-22| certainty |23-24| . |25-25|

 European tourists |0-2| are rare |3-4| here |5-5| , the |6-7| journey from |8-9| the capital |10-11| of |12-12| Azerbaijan |13-14| , |15-15| Baku |16-16| , |17-17| is |18-18| far too |19-20| painful . |21-22| 
 it |0-0| takes eight |1-2| hours to travel |3-5| the |6-6| 323 |7-7| kilometers |8-8| , because |9-10| the road |11-12| has only one |13-17| way |18-18| . |19-19| 
 the province |0-1| has not yet |2-5| benefited from |6-7| the |8-8| legendary |10-10| wealth |9-9| that |11-11| the country |12-13| owes to |14-15| its oil reserves |16-19| in |20-20| the Caspian Sea |21-23| . |24-24| 
 however , |0-1| Pilata |2-2| Fatulayeva |3-3| , |4-4| 48 |5-5| years |6-6| , |7-7| is convinced |8-9| that |10-10| Lerik |11-11| has |12-12| the potential |13-14| to become |15-16| a |17-17| tourist spot |18-19| . |20-20|

 she |0-0| is the director of the |1-3| museum |4-4| of |5-5| longevity |6-7| , |8-8| the only |9-10| museum |11-11| of |12-12| its |13-13| kind |14-14| in the world |15-16| . |17-17| 
 you can |0-1| discover |2-3| the lives |4-5| of approximately |6-7| eight |8-8| tens of |9-10| Talysh |11-11| region |12-14| who have |15-16| more than |17-18| 100 years |19-20| . |21-21| Fatulayeva |22-22| shows us |23-24| a |25-25| black and white photo |26-30| . |31-31| 
 here &apos;s |0-0| my |1-1| grandfather |2-4| , |5-5| he |6-6| has reached |7-8| the age |9-10| of |11-11| 120 |12-12| years |13-13| . |14-14| 
 still have |0-1| a child |2-3| to |4-4| 136 |5-5| years |6-6| 
 but |0-0| the |1-1| controversial |3-3| star |2-2| of the museum |4-5| is |6-6| Şirali |7-7| Müslümov |8-8| , |9-9| a shepherd |10-11| who |12-12| had |13-14| 168 |15-15| years |16-16| . |17-17| 
 however , there is |0-3| no |4-5| birth certificate |6-8| . |9-9| 
 and |0-0| when you |1-2| think that |3-4| the |5-5| oldest |6-7| documented |9-9| person |8-8| had |10-10| 122 |11-11| years |12-12| , |13-13| the age |14-15| of |16-16| Müslümov |17-17| seems to be more |18-19| than questionable |20-21| . |22-22| 
 &quot; |0-0| he |1-1| was born |2-3| in 1805 |4-5| in |6-6| this region |7-8| , |9-9| he died |10-12| in 1973 |13-14| , &quot; says |15-17| Fatulayeva |18-18| . |19-19| 
 the man |0-1| was |2-3| married |4-4| three times |5-6| and |7-7| he |8-8| would have been |9-10| 23 |11-11| children . |12-13| at |14-14| the age |15-16| of |17-17| 136 |18-18| years |19-19| , |20-20| he |21-21| would still have |22-23| designed |24-24| a girl |25-26| . |27-27| 
 Şirali |0-0| Müslümov |1-1| would he |2-5| deceived |6-6| by a few |7-8| decades |9-9| by calculating |10-11| his age |12-13| ? |14-14| 
 Rembrandt |0-0| Scholz , |1-2| gerontologist |3-3| at |4-4| the Max Planck Institute |5-9| in Rostock |10-11| , |12-12| he |13-13| has also |14-15| heard of |16-18| the man |19-20| at the |21-21| great age |22-23| of Central Asia |24-26| . |27-27| 
 &quot; |0-0| older |4-4| people with |1-2| surprisingly |3-3| also live |5-6| in parts |7-9| of China |10-11| , Japan |12-14| or |15-15| in |16-16| the |17-17| Hunza |20-20| Valley |18-19| in Pakistan |21-22| , &quot; |23-24| says |25-25| Scholz , |26-27| &quot; |28-28| in Sardinia |29-30| , too , |31-32| there are men |33-37| who are |38-39| incredibly |40-40| old |41-41| . &quot; |42-43| 
 however , |0-1| it is |2-3| impossible |4-4| to establish |5-6| a |7-7| scientific evidence |8-9| because of |10-12| the lack |13-14| of documents |15-16| , |17-17| not to mention |18-19| that there was |20-24| no |25-26| civil registry |27-30| . |31-31| 
 every day |0-1| , |2-2| a glass |3-4| of |5-5| melted butter |6-7| 
 nevertheless , it is |0-2| a |3-3| fact that |4-5| the people |6-7| of |8-8| the region |9-10| of |11-11| Lerik |12-12| often reach |13-14| an age |15-16| worthy |17-17| of the |18-18| patriarchs |19-19| of |20-20| the Bible |21-22| . |23-23| 
 currently |0-0| , 20 |1-2| people have |3-4| more than |5-6| 100 years |7-8| . |9-9| 
 so what is |0-2| the reason for |3-5| the longevity |6-7| in |8-8| the south |9-10| of |11-11| the country |12-13| ? |14-14| 
 Farid |0-0| Mugimzadeh |1-1| , the |2-3| Azeri |6-6| tourist guide |4-5| , |7-7| explains |8-8| that the |9-10| Talysh |11-11| have |12-12| specific genes |13-15| . |16-16| 
 by |0-0| contrast , |1-2| Fatulayeva |3-3| , |4-4| the |5-5| museum &apos;s |7-8| director |6-6| , |9-9| believes that |10-11| it is |12-13| a question |14-15| of |16-16| food . |17-18| 
 however |0-0| , it |1-2| does not seem |3-5| plausible |6-6| , |7-7| from a |8-9| nutritional point of view |10-13| , |14-14| that the |15-16| calorie |19-20| @-@ rich meals |17-18| Talysh |21-22| , |23-23| who like |24-25| meat |26-27| , bread |28-30| and |31-32| dairy products |33-35| and |36-36| many |37-38| daily |40-40| drink |39-39| a glass |41-42| of |43-43| melted butter |44-45| , |46-46| are |47-47| good for |48-49| health . |50-52| 
 or is it |0-4| the |5-5| simple |9-9| lifestyle |6-8| that preserves |10-11| the young |12-13| people |14-15| ? |16-16| to |17-17| Cengemiran |18-18| , |19-19| a tiny |20-21| village near |22-24| the town |25-26| of |27-27| Lerik , |28-29| Rubaba |31-31| Mirzayeva |32-32| lives |30-30| . |33-33| 
 with its |0-1| 97 |2-2| years old |3-3| , |4-4| it |5-5| is |6-6| still relatively |7-8| young |9-9| for |10-10| the region |11-12| . |13-13| 
 Mirzayeva |0-0| , |1-1| who |2-2| claims to have |3-4| 143 |5-5| descendants |6-6| , |7-7| lives in |8-9| a modest |10-11| wooden house |12-14| , |15-15| as |16-16| it |17-17| is typical |18-19| to |20-21| see |22-22| throughout |23-24| the Caucasus region |25-28| . |29-29|

 Mirzayeva |0-0| receives |1-1| monthly |2-2| 230 |3-3| manat |4-4| ( about |5-6| the same |7-8| amount |9-10| in euros |11-12| ) |13-13| for |14-14| his retirement |15-16| , |17-17| a sum |18-19| which guarantees |20-21| a good |22-23| standard of living |24-26| in |27-27| the region |28-29| . |30-30| 
 and |0-0| maybe |1-4| the |5-5| long |7-8| greying |9-9| of |10-10| Mirzayeva |11-11| son |6-6| is right |12-13| : |14-14| &quot; |15-15| seniors |16-17| have |18-19| great respect |20-22| in |23-23| our culture |24-25| . &quot; |26-27| 
 they are |0-1| the centre |2-3| of the |4-5| large family |6-7| , they |8-9| are loved |10-11| , |12-12| cared for and |13-14| happy . |15-16| 
 this is a good reason |0-3| to live |4-5| for as long as possible |6-9| . |10-10| 
 the |0-0| &quot; |1-1| human |3-5| rights |2-2| &quot; |6-6| in the |7-9| Constitution |10-10| 
 the revolution |0-1| is reborn |2-2| in Cairo |3-4| . |5-5| 
 rival |2-2| protests |0-1| reveal the |3-4| deep |6-6| divide |5-5| in the country |7-8| . |9-9| 
 the draft constitution |0-3| based on |4-5| sharia law |6-7| is |8-8| fiercely |9-9| controversial . |10-11| 
 Egyptian President |0-2| is not |3-5| short on |6-7| words |8-8| so full |9-9| of emotion |10-11| . |12-12| 
 we need to |0-1| make the transition |2-4| . |5-5| 
 &quot; and |0-1| this success |2-3| is my responsibility |4-7| to the people |8-10| and |11-11| to God |12-13| , &quot; |14-15| he |16-20| said |21-21| on state television |22-26| . |27-27| 
 his speech |0-1| was |2-2| intended for the |3-4| entire people |5-7| , |8-8| but |9-10| especially |11-11| the |12-12| Christian |14-14| Copts |13-13| , |15-15| the Liberals |16-17| , |18-18| informed |20-20| and secular |21-22| Muslims |19-19| . |23-23| 
 because |0-0| all |1-2| members of |3-4| the opposition |5-6| confused and |7-8| hopelessly |9-9| disunited |10-10| are afraid |11-12| . |13-13| 
 they |0-0| are afraid |1-2| of a |3-4| theocracy |5-5| on |6-6| the Nile |7-8| in the hands |9-10| of the powerful |11-12| Muslim Brotherhood |13-14| . |15-15| 
 Mohamed |0-0| Morsi |1-1| said |2-3| , |4-4| almost |5-5| apologizing |6-8| , |9-9| have |10-10| temporarily |11-11| restricted |12-12| the powers |13-14| of the |15-16| Constitutional Court |17-18| and |19-19| expanded its business |20-22| &quot; in order |23-24| to save |25-26| the revolution |27-28| . &quot; |29-30| 
 however , |0-1| the Egyptians |2-3| and |4-4| the world |5-6| does |7-7| not really |9-10| know |8-8| what |11-12| wants to save |13-14| the |15-15| 61 @-@ year @-@ old |17-19| engineer |16-16| , |20-20| who holds |21-22| a |23-23| doctorate from |24-25| the American University |26-28| of Southern California |29-32| . |33-33| 
 the |0-0| judiciary |1-2| will be |3-7| reversed |8-8| ? |9-9| 
 the |0-0| 234 |1-1| articles written |2-3| in haste |4-6| by |7-7| the |8-8| Islamic |12-12| @-@ dominated |11-11| Constituent Assembly |9-10| of |13-13| 100 people |14-15| during a |16-18| night |22-22| tour de force |19-21| of |23-23| fifteen |24-24| hours |25-25| are indeed |26-27| worrisome |28-28| to some extent |29-32| . |33-33| 
 as in |0-1| previous |4-4| constitutions |2-3| , |5-5| the project |6-7| provides that |8-9| the case law |10-11| is based on |12-13| &quot; |14-14| the principles |15-16| of |17-17| Islamic law |18-19| . &quot; |20-21| 
 but what |0-1| really means |2-3| the word |4-5| &quot; |6-6| principles |7-7| &quot; |8-8| ? |9-9| 
 it was |0-1| and it |2-3| is always |4-5| a question |6-7| of interpretation |8-9| , |10-10| and |11-11| there is |12-14| good reason |15-17| to fear |18-19| that Islamists |20-22| are using |23-23| the |24-24| vague wording |25-26| and |27-27| flexibility |28-31| resulting |33-35| legal |32-32| to implement |36-37| a |38-38| stricter |40-41| interpretation |39-39| of |42-42| sharia law |43-44| . |45-45| 
 in |0-0| any case , |1-2| it is |3-4| that |5-5| suggests |6-8| a |9-9| newly introduced |11-12| article |10-10| stipulating that |13-14| , |15-15| with regard to |16-19| all |20-21| matters pertaining to |22-24| sharia law |25-26| , |27-27| al @-@ |30-31| Azhar |32-32| University |28-29| must |33-33| be consulted |34-35| . |36-36| the establishment |37-38| is |39-39| the |40-40| most important |43-45| Islamic |42-42| institution |41-41| in the country |46-47| and |48-48| its brilliance |49-50| shines |51-51| throughout the |52-54| Sunni Islamic |56-57| world |55-55| . |58-58| 
 it may |0-1| , |2-2| but |3-3| does not necessarily mean |4-8| that |9-9| the clergy |10-11| will monitor |12-12| the legislature |13-15| , |16-16| which |17-18| would lead to |19-19| a de facto |20-21| guardianship |22-25| of the |26-26| judiciary |27-28| . |29-29| 
 many points |0-2| of the |3-3| draft |4-5| Constitution |6-6| are |7-7| open to interpretation |8-10| 
 another |0-1| problematic aspect |2-3| is |4-4| the maintenance |5-6| of |7-8| the |9-9| military jurisdiction |10-11| . |12-12| 
 during |0-0| the reign |1-2| of |3-3| Mubarak , |4-5| these |6-6| courts |7-7| fought to |8-10| suppress |11-11| opponents |12-13| . |14-14| 
 after the fall |0-2| of the dictator |3-4| , |5-5| up to |6-7| 11,000 |8-8| civilians |9-9| were detained |10-11| by the military |12-14| . |15-15| 
 the State |0-1| must also |2-3| , |4-4| can be |5-7| read |8-8| in |9-9| the project |10-11| , |12-12| protect &quot; |13-14| the |15-15| true nature |16-17| of the |18-19| Egyptian family |20-21| &quot; and |22-23| &quot; |24-24| promote |25-25| its |26-26| morals |27-27| and values |28-30| . &quot; |31-32| 
 from a |0-1| legal point of view |2-5| , |6-6| the wording |7-8| is so |9-10| vague |11-11| that the |12-13| State institutions |14-17| could even |18-19| control the content |20-22| of art |23-25| and |26-27| literature |28-30| . |31-31| 
 clearly , |0-2| it would be |3-5| simply |6-7| censorship |8-9| . |10-10| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| no article |3-4| does not |5-5| expressly guarantees |6-7| equality |8-9| between |10-10| men |11-12| and |13-13| women |14-15| . |16-16| 
 instead |0-3| , |4-4| another article |5-7| prohibits |8-8| to offend |9-10| or |11-12| slander the |13-14| prophet Muhammad |15-16| or |17-17| his envoys |18-19| . |20-20| 
 however |0-1| , |2-2| the article |3-4| does not define |5-7| what constitutes |8-10| an offence |11-12| or how |13-14| it should |15-16| be |17-17| punished |18-18| . |19-19| 
 just as |0-1| questionable |2-2| is |3-3| the wording |4-5| suggesting |6-7| that it |8-9| is illegal |10-11| to &quot; |12-14| offend |15-15| people |16-17| . &quot; |18-19| 
 is it enough |0-2| to draw |3-4| a caricature |5-6| of the president |7-8| or |9-10| tell a |11-12| joke |13-13| at the expense |14-15| of a |16-17| lawyer |18-20| ? |21-21| 
 many points |0-2| are |3-4| open to interpretation |5-7| in |8-8| the project |9-10| that |11-11| Morsi |12-12| will submit to the |13-14| vote and |15-16| who |17-17| , in his own |18-21| words |22-22| , |23-23| &quot; very |25-26| soon &quot; |27-28| will be |24-24| the subject of |29-31| a referendum |32-33| among |34-35| Egyptians |36-36| . |37-37| 
 &quot; |0-0| the revolution |1-2| &quot; |4-4| Returns |3-3| 
 the opposition |0-1| is mobilizing |2-3| for weeks |4-6| against |7-7| the |8-8| numerical superiority |9-10| of the Islamists |11-12| . |13-13| 
 on Friday night |0-1| , |2-2| tens |3-4| of thousands |5-6| of demonstrators |7-8| gathered |9-11| in |12-12| an |13-13| unusual |15-15| harmony |14-14| in Tahrir Square |16-19| in Cairo |20-21| , |22-22| promising to |23-24| bring |25-26| sharia law |27-28| before it |29-31| comes into |32-33| force |34-34| . |35-35| 
 &quot; |0-0| the revolution |1-2| is reborn |3-3| and |4-4| we will |5-6| win |7-7| , &quot; |8-9| lance |10-10| Hamdin |11-11| Sabbahi |12-12| , who came |13-14| third |15-15| in the presidential elections |16-18| . |19-19| 
 the |0-0| Nobel Peace Prize laureate |1-5| and |6-6| former |7-8| head of |9-10| the |11-11| International Atomic Energy |13-17| Agency , |12-12| Mohamed |18-18| El |19-19| Baradei |20-20| said |21-22| that the |23-24| draft |25-26| Constitution is |27-28| &quot; |29-29| thrown into |30-32| the dustbin of history |33-37| . &quot; |38-39| 
 on Twitter |0-1| , the |2-3| instant messaging |5-7| service |4-4| , |8-8| he |9-10| accused |11-11| Morsi &apos;s |14-15| supporters |12-13| of trying to |16-17| foment |18-18| a |19-19| &quot; |20-20| coup |21-21| against |22-22| democracy |23-24| . &quot; |25-26| 
 &quot; |0-0| if he |1-2| proclaims |3-3| the referendum |4-5| , we |6-7| will go to |8-9| his palace |10-11| and |12-13| the |14-14| reverse |15-15| , &quot; |16-17| exclaims |18-19| Jasser |20-20| Said |21-21| , |22-22| an opponent |23-24| . |25-25| 
 &quot; |0-0| we are not |1-4| yet |5-5| tired |6-6| , |7-7| the blood |8-9| of |10-10| our brothers |11-12| is not yet |13-16| redeemed |17-17| , &quot; said |18-21| according to the |22-23| Egyptian media |24-25| Khaled |26-26| Ali |27-27| , |28-28| a |29-29| politician |30-31| and |32-32| a member of |33-34| the opposition |35-36| . |37-37| 
 in addition |0-1| , several |2-3| judges |4-4| have announced |5-6| not wanting to |7-9| monitor |10-10| the referendum |11-12| , |13-13| which |14-15| would lead to |16-16| its |17-17| annulment |18-18| . |19-19| 
 &quot; |0-0| the Koran |1-2| is our |3-4| constitution |5-5| . &quot; |6-6| 
 for its part |0-2| , |3-3| the |4-4| Muslim |6-6| Brotherhood |5-5| , |7-7| well organized |8-9| , called for |10-13| a counter |14-15| @-@ demonstration |16-17| in Tahrir Square |20-23| , not |18-19| as a precautionary measure , |24-28| but |29-29| on |30-30| the other side |31-33| of the Nile |34-35| , where |36-37| a large |38-39| prayer |40-40| was |41-41| held |42-42| in front of |43-43| Cairo |46-47| University |44-45| . |48-48| 
 veiled women |0-2| and supporters |3-5| of the |6-6| Salafists |7-7| , |8-8| who |9-9| participated |10-12| in large numbers |13-15| , |16-16| chanted : |17-18| &quot; |19-19| the people |20-21| calling for the application |22-24| of |25-25| the law |26-27| of God |28-29| . &quot; |30-31| 
 &quot; |0-0| cleans |1-1| our country |2-3| ! |4-4| , &quot; |5-6| calling |7-7| for |8-10| Morsi , |11-12| saying |13-14| that &quot; |15-16| the Koran |17-18| &#91; |19-19| their |20-21| &#93; |22-22| Constitution |23-23| . &quot; |24-25| 
 a struggle for |0-2| sovereignty over |3-5| the |6-6| symbolic |7-7| place |8-8| Thahir |9-9| , |10-10| where it all |11-12| began |13-13| , |14-14| would |15-15| soon |16-17| created a |18-19| situation |20-20| similar to that |21-23| of a |24-25| civil war |26-27| . |28-28| 
 obviously |0-2| , |3-3| it is what |4-7| Morsi &apos;s |10-11| supporters |8-9| wanted to |12-12| avoid |13-13| . |14-14| 
 the Muslim Brotherhood |0-2| said |3-4| that |5-5| opponents of the |6-8| draft |9-10| constitution , |11-12| as well as |13-16| his supporters |17-18| , |19-19| had spoken |20-22| loud and clear |23-25| . |26-26| 
 according to them |0-1| , |2-2| it is |3-4| now time |5-6| to let |7-8| the people |9-10| decide |11-11| through the ballot box |12-14| in the |15-16| direction of |17-20| the country |21-22| . |23-23| 
 the project |0-1| of the Islamists |2-3| will win |4-4| the |5-6| majority |7-7| . |8-8| 
 &quot; |0-0| human rights |1-5| are not mentioned |6-9| once |10-12| . &quot; |13-13| 
 Hafez |0-0| Abu |1-1| Saeda |2-2| is |3-3| angry with |4-6| this |7-7| constitutional process |8-9| imposed |10-10| that would have |11-12| had to |13-13| be extended |14-15| until February |16-18| and |19-19| encompass |20-20| all |21-22| social forces |23-24| . |25-25| 
 this |0-0| human rights |2-6| lawyer |1-1| for |7-7| 48 |8-8| years |9-9| and |10-10| president of |11-12| the |13-13| Egyptian |15-15| Organization |14-14| for Human Rights |16-20| ( |21-21| EOHR |22-22| ) |23-23| had |24-24| defended the |25-26| Muslim Brotherhood |27-28| when they |29-30| were |31-31| in prison |32-33| or |34-34| in the courts |35-37| under |38-38| Mubarak |39-39| . |40-40| 
 he did |0-3| not because |4-7| he shared |8-9| their |10-10| view of the world |11-13| , |14-14| but |15-15| because |16-17| for him |18-19| human rights |20-24| are indivisible |25-26| . |27-27| 
 that is |0-1| the reason why |2-5| he |6-6| was |7-8| beaten |9-11| , |12-12| tried and |13-14| imprisoned |15-15| . |16-16| 
 &quot; |0-0| and now |1-2| , |3-3| the term |4-5| is not even |6-9| spoken once |10-12| in |13-13| the |14-14| new Constitution |15-16| , &quot; |17-18| he says |19-23| during |24-26| his |27-27| interview with |28-29| the |30-30| Welt |31-31| am |32-32| Sonntag |33-33| . |34-34| 
 the extension |0-1| of |2-2| Morsi &apos;s |4-5| powers |3-3| to the three |6-7| powers |8-8| has |9-9| discouraged |10-10| the lawyer |11-12| . |13-13| 
 these measures |0-1| are |2-2| blatant |5-5| violations of |3-4| the rules |6-7| of |8-8| democracy |9-10| and |11-11| they |12-12| will create |13-13| a new |14-15| dictatorship |16-16| in Egypt |17-18| . |19-19| 
 &quot; |0-0| instead |1-2| of strengthening |3-4| civil |7-7| society |5-6| , the |8-9| de facto |13-14| president |10-10| denied |11-12| all its powers |15-17| , &quot; |18-19| deplores |20-20| Saeda |21-21| . |22-22| 
 yet , |0-1| a democracy |2-3| cannot |4-5| function without |6-7| civil |12-12| society organizations |8-11| . |13-13| 
 Saeda |0-0| feels |1-2| neglected , |3-4| including |5-6| by |7-7| the |8-8| international community |9-10| , which |11-12| looks at |13-13| the battle |14-15| between |16-16| the different |17-18| political ideologies |19-20| on |21-21| the edge |22-23| of the Nile |24-25| with |26-26| a mixture |27-28| of |29-29| curiosity |30-30| and |31-32| nervousness |33-33| . |34-34| 
 this could |0-1| afford |2-3| . |4-4| 
 a protester |0-1| in the square |2-4| Thahir |5-5| warns |6-8| : |9-9| &quot; |10-10| you |11-11| giving birth |12-12| to |13-13| a monster |14-15| that |16-16| you will no longer be |17-21| possible |22-22| to control |23-24| . &quot; |25-26| 
 the |0-0| Norwegian |2-3| rakfisk |1-1| : |4-4| is this |5-8| the most |11-12| fragrant |13-13| fish |9-10| in the world |14-15| ? |16-16| 
 the five |0-1| million people |2-4| who live in |5-6| Norway |7-8| enjoy |9-10| one of the |11-12| highest levels |13-15| of life |16-17| , |18-18| not just |19-20| in Europe |21-22| but |23-24| also |25-25| in |26-26| the world |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the secret of |0-2| the success |3-4| of the country |5-6| could |7-7| be |8-10| linked to |11-12| local |16-16| appetite |13-15| for |17-17| an |18-18| extremely |20-20| fragrant |21-21| fish |19-19| ? |22-22| 
 take |0-0| cheese |1-2| . |3-4| 
 place them |0-2| in the middle |3-4| of a |5-6| pile of |7-8| wet |12-12| and dirty |13-14| football |10-11| clothes |9-9| . |15-15| 
 wait a |0-1| week . |2-3| 
 and |0-0| you get |1-2| the smell |3-4| disturbing |5-5| the |6-6| rakfisk |7-7| , |8-8| one of |9-11| the most popular |13-15| dishes |12-12| of |16-16| Norway |17-17| . |18-18| 
 I |0-0| am |1-1| in the small town of |2-6| Fagernes |7-7| , |8-8| at about |9-10| 3 |11-11| hours |12-12| of Oslo |13-14| . |15-15| 
 the |0-0| snow |1-1| , |2-2| the landscape |3-4| is spectacular |5-6| - |7-7| and |8-8| this smell |9-10| , |11-11| ubiquitous |12-12| , permeates |13-14| the air |15-16| . |17-17| 
 the |0-0| rakfisk |1-1| consists |2-3| of trout |4-5| sprinkled with |6-7| salt and |8-9| fermented |10-10| in water for |11-14| a period |15-16| - |17-17| according to |18-18| the smell |19-20| you want |21-23| it |24-25| exhales |26-26| - |27-27| which |28-28| can be up to |29-32| a year |33-34| . |35-35| 
 when |0-0| darkness |1-2| settles |3-4| and |5-5| it &apos;s cold |6-9| , |10-10| the Norwegians |11-12| congregate |13-14| en masse to |15-17| attend |18-19| a festival |20-21| that takes place |22-24| here |25-25| , |26-27| Fagernes |28-28| , |29-29| devoted |30-30| to this |31-32| incredible |35-35| delicacy |33-34| . |36-36| 
 &quot; |0-0| you eat |1-2| raw , |3-4| then |5-5| you |6-6| swallow |7-7| a glass |8-9| of |10-10| aquavit |11-11| , &quot; |12-13| says |14-14| Havard |15-15| Halvarsen |16-16| , |17-17| full @-@ time |20-22| local |19-19| firefighter |18-18| also known as |23-27| &quot; |28-28| Rakfisk |29-29| General |30-30| , &quot; |31-32| responsible for |33-34| the management |35-36| of the festival |37-38| . |39-39| 
 around us |0-2| , people |3-5| swallow |6-6| small pieces of |7-10| fish and |11-12| slip |13-14| a large amount |15-17| of |18-18| drink |19-19| . |20-20| 
 &quot; |0-0| some people |1-2| prefer |3-3| to |6-6| aquavit |4-5| rakfisk |7-7| , &quot; says |8-10| Havard |11-11| . |12-12| 
 drink |0-1| kills |2-2| the smell |3-4| . |5-5| 
 I try |0-1| a few |2-2| pieces |3-3| . |4-4| 
 if |0-0| you can |1-2| avoid |3-5| getting |6-7| under your |8-9| nose |10-10| , |11-11| it &apos;s not |12-15| bad |16-16| - |17-17| it is reminiscent of |18-21| a |22-22| sushi |23-23| who |24-24| would have |25-25| spent long |26-28| hours |29-29| in |30-30| a bus |31-32| . |33-33| 
 the |0-0| rakfisk |1-1| dates back to |2-3| a time when |4-6| Norway |7-8| was poor |9-10| , |11-11| before |12-12| the invention |13-14| of |15-15| refrigeration |16-17| , |18-18| the fish |19-20| was |21-21| immersed |22-22| in |23-24| waterproof |28-28| barrels of water |25-27| in |29-29| the air |30-31| , then |32-33| salted |34-34| in autumn |35-36| . |37-37| 
 then |0-0| , |1-1| during |2-4| the winter |5-6| , |7-7| once |8-9| well |10-10| fermented |11-11| , |12-12| the fish |13-14| came out |15-16| and |17-17| - |18-18| no doubt |19-21| with |22-22| the senses |23-24| undermined by |25-26| alcohol |27-28| - |29-29| eaten |30-30| . |31-31| 
 in |0-0| the |1-1| previous generation |2-3| , thousands |4-6| of |7-7| Norwegians |8-8| were forced |9-11| to leave |12-13| their country |14-15| to find work |16-19| , |20-20| mainly |22-22| emigrating |21-21| to the United States |23-27| . |28-28| 
 at |0-0| present |1-1| , |2-2| the population |3-4| is growing rapidly |5-7| - |8-8| more than |9-10| 13 |11-11| per cent |12-12| are immigrants |13-15| , |16-16| attracted by |17-18| the |19-19| full employment |20-21| , high |22-24| wages and |25-26| a |27-27| comprehensive |31-31| health |29-30| system |28-28| . |32-32| 
 the Swedes |0-1| , |2-2| their old |3-4| rivals , |5-5| whose country |6-8| was |9-9| not |10-14| so long ago |15-16| richer than |17-19| Norway |20-21| , |22-22| crossing the |23-24| border to |25-26| come to work |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the |0-0| rakfisk |1-1| is |2-2| regarded as |3-4| something important |5-8| , |9-9| a |10-10| vital element |11-12| , |13-13| although |14-15| fragrant |16-16| , |17-18| Norway &apos;s |20-22| past |19-19| . |23-23| 
 this |0-0| is part |1-2| of |3-3| the most expensive |5-7| dishes |4-4| . |8-8| 
 but |0-0| everything is |1-2| expensive - |3-4| a small |5-6| pint |7-7| of beer |8-9| or |10-10| a sandwich |11-12| will cost |14-14| you |13-13| € 10 |15-16| each . |17-18| 
 Norway |0-1| does not |2-4| often |5-5| speak of |6-7| it |8-8| in the |9-10| international |12-12| news |11-11| , |13-13| which is not |14-18| to |19-19| displease |21-21| him |20-20| . |22-22| 
 here |0-0| , people |1-3| are not |4-6| willing to |7-8| speak of |9-10| Anders |11-11| Breivik |12-12| , the |13-14| racist |15-15| right @-@ wing |17-18| extremist |16-16| who |19-19| killed |20-21| 77 |22-22| people , including |23-26| women |27-28| and children |29-31| . |32-32| 
 when they talk about |0-2| the killing |3-4| , |5-5| they talk about |6-8| &quot; |9-9| the incident on |10-12| 22 |13-13| July |14-14| . &quot; |15-16| 
 the Norwegians |0-1| have |2-2| difficulty accepting |3-6| that |7-7| in their |8-9| peaceful country |10-11| , |12-12| one of their own |13-16| could |17-18| commit |19-19| such an act |20-22| of barbarism |23-24| . |25-25| 
 since the early |0-3| 1970s |4-5| , |6-6| Norway |7-8| owes its |9-10| wealth |11-11| to its |12-13| oil and gas industry |14-17| , |18-18| one of the largest |19-23| in the world |24-25| . |26-26| 
 &quot; |0-0| but |1-1| oil |2-3| is not |4-6| the |7-7| sole |9-9| reason |8-8| that justifies |10-11| our success |12-13| , &quot; |14-15| said Anna |16-17| , |18-18| our |19-19| waitress |20-20| , |21-22| the |23-23| blond hair |24-25| and |26-27| blue |29-31| eyes |28-28| transfixing |32-32| , |33-33| the image |34-35| of the |36-36| Nordic |40-40| welfare |37-39| , |41-41| with |42-42| a |43-43| hand @-@ |47-49| rakfisk |46-46| plateau |44-45| . |50-50| 
 we are |0-1| - |2-2| how |3-3| do you say |4-6| - people |7-9| conservative . |10-11| 
 his English |0-1| , |2-2| like |3-5| most people |6-9| who live |10-11| here |12-12| , |13-13| is perfect |14-15| . |16-16| 
 we are |0-1| discreet |2-2| , |3-3| we do not like |4-7| to |8-9| point out |10-10| . |11-11| 
 Norway |0-1| has |2-2| managed |3-3| its |4-4| oil wealth |5-6| with great |7-9| caution |10-10| - |11-11| all , |12-13| with the exception |14-16| of a |17-18| small percentage |19-20| of money |21-22| from |23-24| this industry |25-26| , |27-27| is |28-28| invested in |29-30| a |31-31| special fund |32-33| for the benefit |34-35| of future generations |36-38| . |39-39| 
 when other countries |0-3| were throwing |4-4| money down the drain |5-9| , |10-10| over the years |11-14| that |15-15| have led us |16-18| to |19-19| the international financial crisis |20-23| , |24-24| Norway |25-26| has kept |27-29| its purse |30-34| tightly |35-36| . |37-37| 
 &quot; |0-0| as long as we |1-4| can go skiing |5-6| in winter |7-8| and |9-9| hiking |10-13| in the summer |14-15| , |16-16| we are |17-18| happy |19-19| , &quot; says |20-22| Anna |23-23| . |24-24| 
 &quot; |0-0| without forgetting |1-2| the |3-3| rakfisk |4-4| , &quot; |5-6| she says |7-11| in a |12-13| carefree |15-15| laugh |14-14| . |16-16| 
 I &apos;m standing |0-3| in |4-4| the snow |5-6| and |7-7| I am |8-9| queuing up to |10-12| buy |13-14| food |15-17| - |18-18| I had |19-21| my |22-22| rakfisk |25-25| dose |23-24| . |26-26| 
 on the menu |0-1| , |2-2| a hamburger |3-4| consisting of |5-6| momentum , |7-8| a real |9-10| discovery |11-11| , |12-12| it is |13-14| excellent |15-15| . |16-16| 
 but |0-0| tonight |1-2| , |3-3| the smell |4-5| of fish |6-7| is everywhere |8-9| . |10-10| 
 the hotel |0-1| in which |2-3| I |4-4| stayed |5-5| is one |6-8| of the many |9-10| places where |11-12| it |13-14| serves |15-15| the |16-16| rakfisk |17-17| for |18-18| dinner |19-19| and |20-20| where you can |21-24| vote for |25-26| the best |27-28| of them |29-31| - |32-32| or |33-33| perhaps |34-37| the strongest scent |38-40| of them |41-43| . |44-44| 
 there is a |0-3| TV show |4-6| where |7-7| the presenter |8-9| wears a |10-11| knot |12-12| @-@ |13-13| butterfly |14-14| , |15-15| surrounded by |16-17| rakfisk |20-20| bases |18-19| . |21-21| 
 it is |0-2| in |3-3| the |6-6| Eurovision |7-7| contest |4-5| . |8-8| 
 &quot; |0-0| what |1-1| did you |3-5| score |2-2| given |6-6| to the best |7-8| fish , |9-10| in |11-11| the mountains |12-13| Thor |14-14| @-@ |15-15| Juergen |16-16| ? |17-17| &quot; |18-18| 
 &quot; this is |0-1| our points |2-3| , |4-4| Havard |5-5| . &quot; |6-7| 
 heard |0-1| the |2-2| laughter |3-3| and |4-5| applause |6-6| . |7-7| 
 a man |0-1| falls from |2-3| his chair |4-5| , |6-6| perhaps |7-9| because of |10-12| the abuse |13-14| of |15-15| aquavit |16-16| . |17-17| 
 or |0-0| perhaps |1-3| it is because |4-7| of the |8-8| fumes |9-9| of fish |10-11| . |12-12| 
 Mexico |1-1| &apos;s |0-0| Enrique |2-2| Pena |3-3| Nieto |4-4| is |5-5| a |6-6| difficult start |7-8| . |9-9| 
 while |0-1| the |2-2| incoming President |3-4| Enrique |5-5| Pena |6-6| Nieto |7-7| prepares to |8-10| take |11-11| office |12-13| in Mexico |14-15| , Will |16-17| Grant |18-18| , |19-20| the BBC |21-22| , |23-23| looks at the challenges |24-27| that lie ahead |28-30| and |31-31| the expectations |32-33| of the people |34-35| , |36-36| who |37-37| are numerous |38-39| . |40-40| 
 road traffic |0-2| in Mexico City |3-4| is particularly |5-6| bad |7-7| at the moment |8-11| . |12-12| 
 in |0-0| a city |1-2| where |3-3| traffic jams |4-5| are legion |6-7| in normal times |8-10| , |11-11| a dam |12-13| safety |14-15| has |16-16| been put |17-18| in place |19-20| since Monday |21-22| , blocking |23-24| several |25-25| key |28-28| roads |26-27| in the capital |29-31| and |32-32| causing |33-33| chaos |34-36| on |37-37| the roads |38-39| . |40-40| 
 nevertheless , |0-1| the goal |2-3| was not |4-6| to prevent |7-8| people |9-10| from going to |11-14| their work |15-16| , |17-17| but |18-18| to prevent |19-20| the demonstrators |21-22| from reaching |23-24| Parliament |25-26| . |27-27| 
 next Saturday |0-1| , the |2-3| new President |4-5| of Mexico |6-7| , |8-8| Enrique |9-9| Pena |10-10| Nieto |11-11| , |12-12| will receive |13-13| the |14-14| presidential sash |15-16| to become |17-18| the new president |19-21| at the helm of |22-25| the nation |26-27| . |28-28| 
 a |0-0| complicated task |1-2| ahead |3-4| . |5-5| 
 Mexico &apos;s economy |0-3| is doing well |4-6| , |7-7| the results |8-9| that |10-10| the |11-14| outgoing President |15-16| Felipe |17-17| Calderon |18-18| , |19-19| but |20-20| the country |21-22| is |23-23| in the throes of a |24-27| drug |29-31| war |28-28| that has |32-33| already |34-34| claimed the lives of |35-38| some 60,000 |39-40| people |41-41| in six years |42-44| . |45-45| 
 &quot; |0-0| my |1-1| government has |2-3| made a |4-5| commitment to |6-7| the |8-8| Mexican people |9-10| to reduce |11-12| violence |13-14| , &quot; said |15-18| Mr. |19-19| Pena |20-20| Nieto |21-21| to |22-22| US President |23-24| Barack |25-25| Obama |26-26| in the |27-28| Oval Office |29-30| earlier this |31-35| week . |36-37| 
 I will |0-1| propose |2-2| a new |3-4| security strategy |5-9| that will allow us to |10-13| achieve this goal |14-16| . |17-17| 
 before |0-0| with |1-2| the |3-3| American president |4-5| , |6-6| Mr. |7-7| Pena |8-8| Nieto |9-9| was |10-10| governor of |11-12| the State |13-14| of Mexico |15-16| . |17-17|

 &quot; we |0-1| are counting on |2-3| him to |4-5| create |6-8| lasting change |9-11| , &quot; said |12-15| his friend |16-17| and |18-18| political ally |19-20| Gabriel |21-21| Olvera |22-22| Hernandez , |23-24| a member |25-26| of the congress |27-28| and |29-29| M |33-33| Pena |34-34| Nieto |35-35| &apos;s party |30-32| , |36-36| the PRI |37-38| . |39-39| 
 in terms of security |0-3| and economy |4-6| in particular |7-7| , |8-8| we expect |9-10| a real |11-12| change that |13-14| our country |15-16| desperately needs |17-19| . |20-20| 
 unwavering |3-4| after |0-0| 81 |1-1| years |2-2| in power |5-6| , |7-7| the PRI |8-9| was |10-11| ousted |12-12| in 2000 |13-14| by |15-15| Vicente |16-16| Fox |17-17| . |18-18| 
 the member |0-1| of Congress |2-3| Olvera |4-4| admits |5-5| that after |6-7| 12 |8-8| years |9-10| outside the |11-13| presidential palace |14-15| of |16-16| Los |17-17| Pinos , |18-19| there are a lot |20-23| of expectations |24-25| within the party |26-29| on |30-30| Enrique |31-31| Pena |32-32| Nieto |33-33| . |34-34| 
 he |0-0| rejects |1-1| the criticism |2-3| from opponents |4-5| who |6-6| complain that the |7-8| new president |9-10| of lacking |11-12| charisma |13-14| . |15-15|

 however , |0-1| this is not always |2-6| the |7-7| image people have |8-12| of their |13-14| former governor |15-16| . |17-17| 
 in |0-0| Nezahualcoyotl |1-1| , |2-2| also |3-3| known as |4-8| Ciudad |9-9| Neza |10-11| the contrast |12-13| with |14-14| the cobbled streets |15-17| of |18-18| Valle |19-19| del |20-20| Bravo |21-21| could not |22-24| be more |25-26| glaring . |27-28|

 and |0-0| the problems |1-2| in |3-3| the municipality |4-5| are also |6-7| concrete and |8-9| urban . |10-11| 
 earlier in |0-2| the year |3-4| , |5-5| the |6-6| military has |7-8| been |9-9| called to |10-11| the rescue |12-13| in the fight |14-15| against |16-16| drug |19-20| gangs |17-18| in |21-23| the neighborhoods |24-25| , |26-26| and |27-27| violence against women |28-32| are particularly |33-35| serious . |36-37| 
 in |0-0| a disaster zone |1-3| , |4-4| it was |5-6| found , |7-8| on the edge |9-10| of |11-11| discharge |12-12| , |13-13| the bodies |14-15| of dozens |16-17| of |18-18| murdered women |19-20| over the past two |21-25| years |26-26| . |27-27| 
 more than |0-1| 1,000 |2-2| women were killed |3-6| in |7-7| the state |8-9| of Mexico |10-11| while |12-13| Mr. |14-14| Pena |15-15| Nieto |16-16| was |17-17| governor |18-18| , |19-19| a much higher rate |20-24| than in |25-26| the |27-27| most |28-28| violent |29-29| city of |30-31| Ciudad |32-32| Juarez |33-33| - |34-34| a place |35-36| notorious |37-38| for |39-39| the number |40-41| of |42-42| innocent women |43-44| who |45-46| were killed |47-49| . |50-50| 
 critics |0-1| of |2-2| Mr. |3-3| Pena |4-4| Nieto |5-5| , |6-6| say |7-7| that , at best |8-10| , it |11-12| has failed to |13-17| stem the |18-19| problem of |20-21| murders |22-22| perpetrated |23-23| against |24-24| women |25-26| when he |27-28| was |29-29| in office . |30-32| 
 at worst |0-1| , |2-2| they accuse |3-4| his |5-5| administration of |6-7| refusing to |8-9| see |10-10| the |11-11| reality |12-14| . |15-15| 
 in a concrete house |0-4| , typical |5-6| of this |7-8| ramshackle |10-10| neighborhood |9-9| , |11-11| Irinea |12-12| Buendia |13-13| struggle to |14-15| hold back the tears |16-18| when she |19-20| shows me |21-22| pictures |23-24| of his |25-26| deceased |28-28| daughter |27-27| , |29-29| Mariana |30-30| Luna |31-31| . |32-32| 
 the |0-0| official version |1-2| reported |3-5| a |6-6| suicide |7-7| committed by |8-9| Mariana |10-10| in 2010 |11-12| . |13-13| 
 however , |0-1| his family |2-3| believe she |4-6| was killed by |7-10| her partner |11-12| . |13-13| 
 &quot; when |0-1| I arrived |2-4| home |5-6| , |7-7| it seemed to me that |8-12| his body |13-14| had |15-15| been |16-16| washed |17-17| , &quot; |18-19| says |20-20| the |21-21| Señora |22-22| Buendia |23-23| . |24-24| 
 signs |0-1| indicated |2-2| that she had |3-5| been |6-6| beaten |7-7| , |8-8| and |9-9| rigor mortis was |10-13| already underway |14-15| . |16-16| 
 while |0-1| his mother |2-3| tells the story |4-6| , |7-7| a photo |8-9| of |10-10| Mariana |11-11| dress up |12-12| the wall |13-14| , |15-15| next to |16-18| a cross |19-20| which contains |21-22| the word |23-24| : |25-25| justice . |26-27| 
 however , |0-1| this is exactly what |2-6| the family |7-8| has been denied |9-12| . |13-13| 
 the authorities |0-1| have |3-3| treated |4-4| me |2-2| as if |5-6| I was |7-8| an old |9-10| gossipy |11-11| , |12-12| a |13-13| disorder |15-16| festivities |14-14| , |17-17| a |18-18| main problem ? |19-19| . |20-20| 
 they want |0-1| to accept |2-4| what they say |5-8| and |9-10| silencing ourselves |11-13| . |14-14| 
 &quot; |0-0| but it is not |1-5| normal that |6-7| there are |8-10| so many |11-12| irregularities |13-13| and |14-14| omissions |15-16| , &quot; |17-18| she |19-23| said . |24-25| 
 when |0-0| President |1-2| Pena |3-3| Nieto |4-4| will receive |5-5| his |6-6| scarf |7-7| on Saturday |8-8| , she |9-10| will be accompanied by |11-13| a |14-14| heavy responsibility |15-16| . |17-17| 
 tens |0-1| of thousands |2-3| of |4-4| families have |5-6| been |7-7| affected by |8-9| crime |10-11| in Mexico |12-13| over the |14-16| past six |17-18| years , and |19-20| the new president |21-23| made |24-25| the promise |26-27| that he |28-29| would make it |30-31| his |32-32| priority during |33-34| his tenure |35-36| . |37-37| 
 &quot; |0-0| I hope |1-2| that it |3-4| will be |5-5| as good |6-7| as president |8-11| when |12-13| he was |14-15| governor |16-16| , &quot; said |17-20| Olvera |21-21| , |22-23| Valle |24-24| del |25-25| Bravo |26-26| , a member |27-28| of Congress |29-30| . |31-31| 
 however , |0-1| this is exactly what |2-6| the |7-7| families of the |8-9| victims of |10-11| Ciudad |12-12| Neza |13-13| fear |14-14| most . |15-17|

 the documents |0-1| were then |2-4| published |5-5| online |6-7| by WikiLeaks |8-9| . |10-10| 
 WikiLeaks |0-0| has never |1-3| confirmed that |4-5| Manning |6-6| was |7-8| their |9-9| source . |10-11| 
 at the hearing |0-3| on Friday |4-5| , |6-6| Fein |7-7| discussed |8-9| with |10-10| Manning |11-11| forms |12-13| that officers |14-16| had |17-17| completed |18-18| after their |19-20| meeting with |21-22| Manning |23-23| , |24-24| during |25-25| his detention |26-27| in |28-28| a |29-29| military prison |30-31| in |32-32| Quantico |33-33| , |34-34| where he |35-36| was |37-38| subjected to |39-40| a |41-41| maximum |44-44| prison |43-43| isolation |42-42| from July |45-46| 2010 |47-47| to April |48-49| 2011 |50-50| . |51-51| 
 the officers |0-1| asked questions |2-5| to |6-6| Manning |7-7| and |8-8| recorded |9-10| her answers |11-12| . |13-13|

 the forms |0-1| do not report any |2-6| complaint of ill @-@ treatment |7-10| , |11-11| although |12-13| the officers |14-15| have |16-17| directly |18-18| asked |19-19| about his |20-23| prison |25-25| treatment |24-24| , &quot; said |26-28| Fein |29-29| . |30-30| 
 Manning |0-0| replied |1-2| that he had |3-5| orally |6-6| expressed |7-7| concerns about some of the |8-11| problems and |12-13| that the |14-15| visiting |17-18| officers |16-16| had discussed |19-21| his concerns |22-23| and |24-24| said they |25-27| would fix them |28-30| , |31-31| but |32-32| they |33-33| have not |34-36| recorded |37-37| the issues raised |38-40| . |41-41| 
 &quot; |0-0| they wrote |1-3| &quot; |4-4| no problem |5-6| &quot; ( |7-8| after addressing |9-11| the concerns |12-13| ) |14-14| , |15-15| and |16-16| at the same time , |17-19| this does |20-21| not mean |22-23| that |24-24| I had not |25-28| caused any problems |29-31| , &quot; said |32-35| Manning |36-36| . |37-37| 
 the |0-0| military judge |1-2| Col. |3-4| Denise |5-5| Lind |6-6| , |7-7| Manning |12-12| was also |8-9| asked |10-11| why |13-13| he |14-14| had not |15-18| complained about his treatment |19-22| in an interview |23-26| in January |27-28| 2011 |29-29| with |30-30| the |31-31| special committee , |32-33| which met |34-37| to discuss |38-39| the |40-40| suicidal thoughts |41-42| he had |43-45| expressed |46-46| in writing |47-48| a few |49-49| months earlier |50-51| . |52-52| 
 Manning |0-0| replied |1-2| that |3-3| his intention |4-5| during |6-6| the meeting |7-8| was to |9-11| amend |12-12| its |13-13| restrictive |15-15| status |14-14| indicating |16-16| a |17-17| &quot; |18-18| risk of injury |19-21| . &quot; |22-23| 
 the military |0-1| said they |2-5| had |7-7| assigned |8-8| him |6-6| the |9-9| restrictive |11-11| status |10-10| -- |12-12| a level |13-14| below the |15-18| close |20-20| monitoring |19-19| for |21-21| suicide risk |22-24| -- |25-25| for his |26-27| protection and |28-29| the safety |30-31| of others . |32-34| 
 &quot; |0-0| I wanted the |1-4| staff |5-5| to know that |6-7| I was going |8-9| well |10-10| , |11-11| and |12-12| I wanted |13-14| that I |15-18| withdraw |19-19| this status |20-21| ... |22-22| to |23-24| enjoy |25-26| a better quality |27-29| of life |30-31| from my |32-33| point of view |34-36| , &quot; said |37-40| Manning |41-41| . |42-42|

 he said that he had |0-3| contemplated |4-4| suicide |5-7| when he |8-9| was |10-10| in Kuwait |11-12| and |13-13| will |14-14| be gone |15-16| once |17-18| because of |19-21| the heat |22-23| . |24-24| 
 he added |0-2| that |3-3| the fact |4-5| that they have not been |6-10| kept informed |11-13| of what he |14-17| was going to happen |18-20| or |21-22| what was going on |23-26| in |27-27| the rest |28-29| of the world |30-31| was very |32-33| scary |34-34| . |35-35| 
 &quot; |0-0| my |1-1| world was |2-3| reduced to |4-5| Camp |6-6| Arafjon |7-7| , |8-9| this |10-10| cage |11-11| , &quot; said |12-15| Manning |16-16| , |17-17| on Thursday . |18-19| 
 I thought |0-2| I was going to die |3-5| in that |6-7| cage . |8-9| 
 once |0-1| in Quantico |2-3| , |4-4| Manning |5-5| said |6-7| he had |8-10| spent most of |11-15| his time |16-17| in a small cell |18-21| -- |22-22| at least |23-24| 21 |25-25| hours |26-26| and sometimes |27-28| more than |29-30| 23 |31-31| hours |32-32| -- |33-33| without |34-34| company . |35-36| 
 manning |0-0| also added |1-3| that |4-4| the only |5-6| available |8-10| objects |7-7| were |11-11| a mattress |12-13| , |14-14| a blanket |15-16| , |17-18| flip @-@ flops |19-19| , clothing |20-22| and |23-23| his glasses |24-25| . |26-26| 
 he tried |0-2| to stay |3-4| in motion |5-6| , because |7-8| sleep or |9-10| stay |11-11| lengthened |12-12| during |13-13| the day |14-15| was contrary |16-17| to the |18-18| rules |19-19| . |20-20| 
 manning |0-0| also said |1-3| that |4-4| when he |5-6| was trying |7-7| to sleep |8-9| , |10-10| he had |11-12| a |13-13| light |14-14| in |15-15| the eyes |16-17| , |18-18| lit |19-19| outside |20-23| his cell |24-25| . |26-26| 
 if |0-0| the guards |1-2| did not see |3-5| his face |6-7| when he |8-9| turned |10-11| the night |12-13| , they |14-15| were awakening him |16-17| in order |18-18| to be able to |19-20| see |21-21| his face |22-23| . |24-24| 
 the |0-0| Manning |3-3| &apos;s lawyer |1-2| filed a |4-6| formal complaint |7-8| to |9-9| the |10-10| treatment of |11-13| Manning |14-14| in January |15-16| 2011 |17-17| . |18-18|

 also on Friday |0-1| , |2-2| the judge |3-4| asked |5-8| to |9-9| Manning |10-10| on |11-11| an allegation |12-13| reported in |14-15| his testimony |16-17| on Thursday |18-19| -- |20-20| after they have |21-23| been forced |24-25| to sleep |26-27| naked |28-28| overnight |29-31| in |32-32| his cell |33-34| at |35-35| Quantico |36-36| , |37-37| he was forced |38-41| to |42-42| stand naked in front of |43-46| the guards |47-48| and |49-49| other |50-51| inmates |52-52| one morning |53-54| , |55-55| during |56-56| the appeal |57-58| . |59-59| 
 Manning |0-0| testified |1-2| that at no time |3-6| , |7-7| he |8-10| was |11-12| allowed |13-13| to cover themselves |14-16| with |17-17| a blanket |18-19| during |20-20| the appeal |21-22| . |23-23| 
 during |0-0| the |1-1| judge &apos;s |3-4| questions |2-2| , |5-5| Friday |6-6| , |7-7| Manning |8-8| said |9-10| he had |11-13| deducted from |14-15| the order |16-17| of his |18-19| guard |20-20| that he had to |21-23| drop |24-24| its coverage |25-26| that could |27-29| hide his |30-31| nakedness |32-32| , |33-33| but |34-34| he acknowledged |35-37| that |38-38| nobody |39-40| ordered him to |41-44| the |45-45| release . |46-47| 
 Manning |0-0| testified |1-2| Thursday |3-3| that he had |4-6| been forced |7-8| to sleep |9-10| naked |11-11| the |12-12| night before |13-14| , because |15-16| he would have |17-18| tried to |19-20| demonstrate to |21-22| an officer |23-24| that he was not |25-29| a danger to |30-32| himself |33-35| . |36-36| 
 manning |0-0| allegedly told |1-3| the officer |4-5| that he |6-7| could |8-9| use the |10-11| elastic |12-12| from |13-13| his underpants |14-15| or |16-17| flip @-@ flops |18-18| to |19-19| get hurt |20-21| , |22-22| but |23-23| that he |24-25| had not done so |26-30| . |31-31|

 his lawyers |0-1| are hoping |2-2| that at least |3-5| the judge |6-7| will take account |8-9| of |10-10| his experiences |11-15| during |16-16| his detention |17-18| and |19-19| that it |20-21| will significantly reduce |22-23| his sentence |24-25| if he |26-27| were to |28-28| be |29-29| convicted |30-31| in a court |32-34| martial |35-35| , |36-36| a trial that |37-39| should |40-40| be held |41-42| early next year |43-47| . |48-48| 
 the defense |0-1| has |2-2| said |3-3| that |4-4| Manning |5-5| intends |6-6| to plead |7-8| guilty |9-9| of |10-10| less serious |12-14| crimes |11-11| and |15-15| to fight for |16-19| the abandonment |20-21| of |22-22| other charges |23-24| deemed |25-25| too extreme |26-27| . |28-28| 
 the hearing |0-1| is expected to resume |2-3| this weekend |4-7| , |8-8| with |9-9| prosecutors |10-11| who |12-12| would |13-13| argue that |14-15| the conditions |16-17| of detention |18-19| were justified |20-21| . |22-22| 
 the Pentagon |0-1| confirmed that |2-4| Manning |5-5| was jailed |6-8| in accordance with the rules |9-11| governing |12-13| the detention conditions |14-17| of |18-18| all |19-20| detainees |21-21| at |22-22| Quantico |23-23| . |24-24| 
 the |0-0| charges |1-4| against |5-8| Manning |9-9| include |10-10| the theft |11-12| of |13-13| public |18-18| property |14-14| or records |15-17| , |19-19| collusion |20-21| with the enemy |22-24| , |25-25| giving rise |26-27| to the |28-29| illegal |31-31| publication |30-30| of |32-32| information on |33-34| the Internet |35-36| , |37-37| and |38-38| the transmission |39-40| of information |41-42| relating to |43-44| national defence . |45-48| 
 if |0-0| all |1-2| charges |3-5| are retained |6-7| , |8-8| he could face |9-10| life imprisonment |11-15| . |16-16| 
 my |0-0| Mexican @-@ American |3-5| identity crisis |1-2| 
 he |0-0| said that |1-2| many have |3-4| been forced |5-6| to leave |7-8| Mexico |9-10| because |11-12| of the |13-13| lack of opportunities |14-16| 
 Mexicans |0-1| tend |2-3| to blame |4-5| those who |6-7| are gone |8-9| ; |10-10| they remind |11-13| Mexicans |14-14| difficult times |15-17| , |18-18| &quot; he |19-23| said . |24-25| 
 Navarrette |0-0| said that |1-2| the |3-3| Mexico |4-4| @-@ Americans |5-6| find themselves |7-8| caught between |9-10| two |11-11| worlds . |12-13| 
 on a recent trip |0-4| to |5-5| Mexico City |6-6| , |7-7| arriving |8-9| in |10-10| the lobby |11-12| , |13-13| before the |14-15| customs |17-18| and immigration |19-21| services |16-16| , |22-22| I felt |23-26| lost |27-27| . |28-28| 
 signs |0-1| indicated |2-2| two tracks |3-4| : |5-5| one for |6-7| the |8-8| &quot; |9-9| Mexicanos |10-10| &quot; ( |11-12| &quot; |13-13| Mexicans |14-14| &quot; ) |15-16| , |17-17| another |18-19| for &quot; |20-22| Extranjeros |23-23| &quot; ( |24-25| &quot; |26-26| Strangers |27-27| &quot; ) |28-29| . |30-30| 
 I stayed |0-2| motionless |3-3| for several |4-5| seconds |6-6| , |7-7| not knowing |8-10| what |12-12| lead |13-13| me |14-14| to |11-11| lead |15-15| . |16-16| 
 I grew up |0-2| in central |3-6| California |7-8| , |9-9| where I was |10-14| called the |15-16| &quot; |17-17| Mexican |18-18| &quot; |19-19| all my life |20-22| . |23-23| 
 it is an |0-4| ethnic |6-6| qualifier |5-5| , |7-7| in the same way |8-10| as |11-13| my friends |14-15| of |16-16| Boston |17-17| use |18-18| when |19-19| they say , &apos; |20-23| Irish &apos; |24-25| , |26-26| or |27-27| my |28-28| friends in |29-30| New York |31-32| when they |33-35| say |36-36| &quot; |37-37| Italian |38-38| . &quot; |39-40| 
 then |0-0| , |1-1| I became |2-4| &quot; Mexico |5-6| @-@ |7-7| American |8-8| . &quot; |9-10| 
 but |0-0| , |1-1| here |2-2| , |3-3| it was |4-5| Mexico |6-7| . |8-8| 
 and |0-0| , |1-1| on |2-2| the land |3-4| that |5-5| was the birthplace of |6-8| my |9-9| grandfather |10-12| , |13-13| there is no need for |14-16| special |18-18| qualifier |17-17| or hyphens |19-23| . |24-24| 
 I was |0-1| just |2-2| an American |3-4| . |5-5| 
 I speak |0-1| Spanish |2-3| well enough |4-5| to manage |6-7| an interview |8-9| in one |10-12| or |13-13| the other |14-15| language . |16-17| 
 but |0-0| I do not have |1-4| the vocabulary |5-6| of an Aboriginal man , |7-10| and |11-11| I can &apos;t |12-15| lose |16-16| my |17-17| American |19-19| accent |18-18| . |20-20| 
 so I took |0-3| my |4-4| U.S. passport |5-6| and |7-7| I headed |8-11| towards |12-12| the queue |13-14| &quot; |15-15| Strangers |16-16| . &quot; |17-18| 
 I thought |0-2| at the time |3-7| of |8-8| the week |9-10| when |11-11| the new |12-13| Mexican President |14-15| Enrique |16-16| Pena |17-17| Nieto |18-18| visited |19-21| President |22-23| Obama , |24-25| at |26-26| the White House |27-30| . |31-31| 
 generally |0-0| , |1-1| when |2-2| the leaders |3-4| of |5-5| the two countries |6-8| meet |9-11| their |12-12| favorite themes |13-15| are |16-16| immigration |17-18| , drugs |19-21| and trade . |22-25| 
 Pena |0-0| Nieto |1-1| had also |2-3| want to |4-5| talk about |6-7| the growth |8-9| of the Mexican economy |10-13| , which |14-15| is |16-16| one of the |17-19| reasons why |20-22| Mexicans |23-24| to stay |25-26| in Mexico |27-28| rather than |29-32| risk |33-33| in the United States |34-37| . |38-38| 
 he wants to |0-1| join forces |2-3| in the United States |4-7| and Canada |8-10| , |11-11| and |12-12| create |13-13| a Union |14-15| for trade |16-18| on |19-19| the model |20-21| of |22-22| the European Union |23-25| , |26-26| but |27-27| in North America |28-31| . |32-32| 
 and |0-0| Pena |1-1| Nieto |2-2| is committed |3-4| to continue |5-6| the war |7-8| against |9-9| drug cartels |10-14| in Mexico |15-16| , |17-17| although he did |18-22| not provide |23-24| further details |25-27| . |28-28| 
 for Mexico |0-2| , |3-3| the relationship |4-5| with the United States |6-10| is complicated |11-12| and |13-13| filled with |14-15| bitterness |16-16| . |17-17| 
 most |0-2| Americans |3-3| have |4-5| probably never |6-7| thought about the |8-9| fact that |10-11| in 1848 |12-13| , |14-14| the United States |15-18| invaded |19-20| Mexico |21-22| and forced |23-24| its leaders |25-26| to surrender |27-28| in writing |29-30| half |31-32| of |33-33| their territory |34-35| at gunpoint |36-40| . |41-41| 
 but |0-0| for |1-1| Mexicans |2-3| , |4-4| who think |5-6| in terms |7-8| of |9-9| centuries |10-10| , |11-11| and |12-12| no |13-14| minutes |15-15| , |16-16| the memories |17-18| are everywhere |19-20| . |21-21| 
 therefore |0-1| , |2-2| once a |3-5| U.S. |7-7| official |6-6| made |8-8| the slightest |9-10| criticism |11-14| of Mexico |15-16| , |17-17| you begin to |18-20| hear |21-21| -- |22-22| in |23-23| the |24-24| Mexican press |25-26| , |27-27| and |28-28| among |29-29| the elites |30-31| -- |32-32| complaints |33-34| about how |35-38| Americans |39-40| infringe on the sovereignty |41-45| of |46-46| their neighbour |47-48| . |49-49| 
 and |0-0| the children |1-2| of |3-3| Montezuma |4-4| seek |5-5| the |6-6| fight . |7-8| 
 and yet |0-1| , |2-2| for Mexico |3-5| , |6-6| the |7-7| most difficult |9-11| relationship |8-8| is |12-12| that |13-14| the country |15-16| has with |17-18| the |19-19| more than |20-21| 35 |22-22| million |23-24| Mexico City |25-25| @-@ |26-26| Americans |27-27| living |28-29| in the United States |30-33| . |34-34| 
 you want to |0-1| address |2-4| the subject |5-6| of |7-7| bitterness |8-9| ? |10-10| 
 there are many |0-4| . |5-5| 
 Mexico |0-1| has its |2-3| winners and losers |4-7| , people |8-10| for whom |11-12| the country |13-14| offers opportunities |15-17| and |18-18| others |19-20| for whom |21-22| the country |23-24| does |25-26| not offer |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the only |0-1| reason for |2-4| the |5-5| large number |6-7| of |8-8| Mexican |10-10| ancestry |9-9| in cities such as |11-14| Los |15-15| Angeles |16-16| , Las |17-18| Vegas |19-19| , |20-20| Phoenix |21-21| , |22-22| Denver |23-23| or |24-24| San |25-25| Antonio |26-26| , |27-27| is |28-28| that at some point |29-33| in |34-35| our |36-36| family tree |37-38| , |39-39| someone |40-41| , |42-42| perhaps |43-45| a parent |46-47| or |48-48| grandparent |49-52| , |53-53| found no |54-57| opportunity |58-58| in Mexico |59-60| and |61-61| had to |62-63| go to |64-65| the North |66-67| . |68-68| 
 and |0-0| more often than not , |1-4| this person |5-6| was |7-8| a |9-9| typical profile |10-11| -- |12-12| a |13-13| dark |15-15| skin |14-14| , |16-16| poorly educated |17-18| , |19-19| from a |20-22| poor village |23-24| , etc . |25-26| 
 we are |0-1| their descendants |2-3| , |4-4| and |5-5| we are |6-7| loyal to |8-9| them . |10-11| 
 not |0-0| Mexico |1-2| . |3-3| 
 and |0-0| even though |1-2| we now live |3-5| the |6-6| American dream |7-8| , |9-9| that |10-10| we went to |11-14| good schools |15-17| and |18-18| we have |19-21| good |22-23| situations , |24-25| we must never |26-29| lose sight of the fact |30-32| that |33-33| it is the |34-36| American dream |37-38| that we |39-40| live in , |41-42| and |43-43| not |44-44| that of |45-46| Mexicans |47-47| . |48-48| 
 our identity |0-1| is sometimes |2-3| troubled |4-4| , |5-5| but |6-6| our loyalty |7-8| is |9-9| obvious . |10-11| 
 we |0-1| attach |2-2| to the |3-3| United States |4-6| . |7-7| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| we know |3-4| that some of |5-8| the |9-9| Mexican |11-11| elite |10-10| among |12-12| the ruling class |13-15| doesn |16-16| &apos;t like |18-19| us |17-17| . |20-20| 
 the feeling |0-1| is mutual . |2-4| 
 we remind them of |0-2| a |3-3| humiliating defeat |4-5| and |6-6| they |7-7| toisent |9-9| us |8-8| as if |10-11| we were |12-13| individuals |14-15| of |16-16| lower |18-18| strain |17-17| and |19-19| not |20-20| Mexican |22-22| enough |21-21| . |23-23| 
 our |0-0| Spanish |1-1| will never be |2-4| good enough |5-6| , |7-7| our |8-8| relationship with |9-10| Mexico |11-12| will never be |13-15| strong enough |16-17| . |18-18| 
 for them |0-1| , |2-2| our existence |3-4| is |5-5| synonymous with |6-7| failure . |8-9| 
 if |0-0| our families |1-2| had not |3-5| failed |6-6| when |7-7| they lived |8-9| in Mexico |10-11| , they |12-13| would never be |14-16| parties . |17-18| 
 and we would |0-4| not |5-5| stuck |6-6| on the right side of |7-10| the barrier |11-12| , living |13-14| comfortably |15-15| in the United States |16-19| , |20-20| but as |21-23| lost souls |24-25| . |26-26| 
 my wife |0-1| , who |2-2| was born |3-4| in Guadalajara |5-6| and |7-7| who |8-8| emigrated |9-10| legally |11-11| in the United States |12-15| when she |16-18| was a child |19-20| , |21-21| reminds me |22-23| that there is |24-26| friction |27-28| between |29-29| Mexicans |30-31| and |32-33| Mexican |34-34| @-@ |35-35| Americans |36-36| , |37-38| Mexicans |39-40| more firmly |42-43| assert |41-41| their identity |44-45| and |46-46| the |47-47| Mexico City |48-48| @-@ |49-49| Americans |50-50| are |51-52| upset |53-53| . |54-54| 
 although |0-3| American citizen |4-5| , |6-6| she had |7-8| the feeling |9-10| of |11-11| being part |12-13| of |14-14| two countries |15-16| . |17-17| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| many |3-4| Mexico City |5-5| @-@ |6-6| Americans |7-7| I know |8-10| do not have |11-13| the impression |14-15| of |16-16| being part of |17-19| a country |20-21| or |22-23| the other |24-25| . |26-26| 
 we love |0-1| the music |2-3| of the |4-4| Mexican |6-6| group |5-5| , |7-7| Los |8-8| Tigres |9-9| del |10-10| Norte , |11-12| but also |13-14| that of |15-16| Bruce Springsteen |17-18| . |19-19| 
 we have |0-1| the best |2-3| of both worlds |4-6| , |7-7| but |8-8| we are not |9-11| rooted in |12-13| any of the |14-15| two |16-16| . |17-17| 
 in Mexico |0-1| , |2-2| we are |3-4| as |5-6| Americans |7-8| . |9-9| 
 and |0-0| in the United States |1-4| , |5-5| we |6-7| regard as |8-9| Mexicans |10-11| . |12-12| 
 and now |0-1| , |2-2| for |3-3| a little more complicated |4-7| the relationship |8-9| , |10-10| as I |11-14| learned |15-15| during |16-16| my stay |17-18| , some |19-20| Mexican |22-22| leaders |21-21| and part of |23-26| the intelligentsia |27-28| want to |29-29| move closer to |30-32| the Diaspora |33-34| . |35-35| 
 they want the |0-3| Mexico |4-4| @-@ |5-5| Americans |6-6| working |7-7| as ambassadors |8-11| of |12-12| fortune for |13-14| Mexico |15-16| , |17-18| representing |19-19| its interests |20-21| in the United States |22-25| . |26-26| 
 we will have to |0-1| explain to |2-3| our |4-4| fellow Americans |5-6| that Mexico |7-9| is a |10-11| beautiful |13-13| country |12-12| that we absolutely must |14-17| visit |18-18| and |19-19| put pressure |20-22| on |23-23| political leaders |24-25| to strengthen |26-27| ties with |28-30| Mexico |31-32| . |33-33| 
 yes |0-0| , of course |1-3| . |4-4| 
 this will not happen |0-3| . |4-4| 
 there is |0-2| too much |3-4| bitterness |5-5| . |6-6| 
 and |0-0| , |1-1| if we consider |2-5| wage |8-9| inequality |6-7| , |10-10| corruption |11-12| and |13-13| drug @-@ |17-19| related violence |14-16| that are |20-21| ubiquitous |22-22| , |23-23| many of us |24-27| are not |28-30| convinced |31-31| that this is |32-36| a |37-37| fantastic country |38-39| . |40-40| 
 you |0-0| are going to have to |1-3| fend for themselves |4-5| , |6-6| amigos |7-7| . |8-8| 
 it |0-0| is normal |1-2| . |3-3| 
 while some |0-1| Mexicans |2-2| are not |3-5| yet ready |6-7| to forgive |8-9| the United States |10-13| for the way they |14-18| have treated |19-20| Mexico |21-22| a |23-26| century |27-27| and |28-28| a half |29-29| , |30-30| they must |31-32| therefore |33-34| accept |35-35| that some |36-37| Mexico City |38-38| Americans |39-40| still |44-44| want |43-43| them |41-42| how |45-48| family members |49-53| were |54-55| treated |56-56| there is not |57-61| so long ago |62-63| . |64-64| 
 hmmm |0-0| . &quot; |1-1| 
 perhaps |0-2| we are |3-5| more |6-6| &quot; |7-7| Mexicans |8-8| &quot; |9-9| than I thought |10-14| . |15-15| 
 old |0-0| quarrels |1-1| , |2-2| new Middle |3-4| East |5-6| 
 the cease |0-1| @-@ fire |2-5| between Israel |6-7| and |8-8| Hamas |9-10| is still |11-12| a failure for |13-15| peace |16-17| . |18-18| 
 will |0-1| there |2-5| ever |6-6| be a |7-9| lasting peace |10-11| between |12-12| the Arabs |13-14| and |15-15| Jews |16-17| in the Middle |18-19| East |20-21| ? |22-22| 
 another |0-1| bloodshed |2-4| seems to indicate |5-6| that such a |7-9| hope is |10-11| futile |12-12| . |13-13| 
 while |0-1| remain |2-2| the same |3-4| futile |6-6| arguments |5-5| about who |7-9| began |10-11| , |12-12| dozens |13-14| of buildings |15-16| were reduced |17-19| to dust |20-21| ; |22-22| more than |23-24| 140 |25-25| Palestinians , |26-27| most |28-29| of them |30-32| were civilians |33-35| , |36-36| and |37-37| six |38-38| Israelis |39-39| were killed |40-42| ; |43-43| and |44-44| , |45-45| for the |46-47| first time |48-49| , |50-50| rockets fired |51-53| from Gaza |54-55| landed |56-57| near |58-59| Tel |60-60| Aviv |61-62| , |63-63| the metropolis |64-65| of Israel |66-67| , |68-68| and |69-69| the |70-70| holy city |71-72| of Jerusalem |73-74| . |75-75| 
 but |0-0| while |1-2| the Israelis |3-4| and |5-5| the Palestinians |6-7| seem to be |8-8| stuck in |9-10| their old |11-12| conflict , |13-14| all around them |15-18| , the |19-20| Middle |21-21| East |22-23| is changing |24-27| . |28-28| 
 the Arab Spring |0-2| has |3-3| just |4-4| shattered |5-8| , |9-9| and |10-10| whether we like it |11-14| or not , |15-17| the Palestinians |18-19| and |20-20| the Israelis |21-22| are |23-23| caught |24-24| by the |25-26| regional |28-28| upheaval |27-27| . |29-29| 
 perhaps |0-2| that |3-3| their fight |4-5| intensifies |6-7| a little more |8-11| . |12-12| 
 yet , |0-1| there is |2-4| every reason |5-7| to believe |8-9| that |10-10| this could |11-12| help them out of |13-17| this impasse |18-19| . |20-21| 
 a war that |0-2| is no |3-5| loser |6-6| and no |7-8| winner |9-9| 
 at first glance |0-2| , |3-3| it seems |4-5| difficult to |6-7| be optimistic |8-11| . |12-12| 
 even if |0-1| the |2-2| ceasefire |3-7| granted |8-8| on 21 |9-10| November |11-11| continues , |12-14| the fighting |15-16| this week |17-19| have strengthened |20-21| the supporters |22-23| of |24-24| the force |25-26| , |27-27| on both sides |28-30| . |31-31| 
 the leaders |0-1| of Hamas |2-3| , the |4-5| Islamist movement |6-7| that |8-8| runs the |9-10| Gaza |11-11| since 2007 |12-13| , |14-15| targueront |16-16| have |17-18| forced |19-19| the Israelis |20-21| to abandon |22-23| , even |24-25| if |26-26| Gaza |27-27| suffered a |28-30| beating |31-31| . |32-32| 
 having killed |0-1| some of |2-3| its leaders |4-5| and |6-6| pushed the |7-8| 1.7 million |9-11| Gazans |12-14| in |15-15| one of |16-18| the most |20-21| impoverished |22-22| and overcrowded |23-24| corners |19-19| of |25-25| the planet |26-27| , Israel |28-29| has failed to |30-34| destroy |35-35| Hamas |36-37| . |38-38| 
 indeed |0-1| , |2-2| Hamas |3-4| is gaining ground |5-7| on |8-8| the West Bank |9-10| , |11-11| the other |12-13| part of Palestine |14-17| currently |18-18| in the hands |19-20| of their |21-22| Fatah |24-25| rivals |23-23| , |26-26| the other |27-28| more moderate |31-32| Palestinian faction |29-30| . |33-33| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| Hamas |5-6| leaders |3-4| could |7-8| say that |9-10| the time |11-12| is their |13-14| ally . |15-16| 
 the influence |0-1| of Islamists |2-3| in the Arab world |4-6| is increasingly |7-11| strong |12-12| , |13-13| and |14-14| Hamas |15-16| has |17-18| made |19-20| rich and powerful |22-24| friends |21-21| . |25-25| 
 Turkey |0-1| , |2-2| a |3-3| booming |6-8| regional power |4-5| , |9-9| formerly |10-10| the |11-11| closest |14-16| Muslim |13-13| ally |12-12| of Israel |17-18| , |19-19| has |20-20| sided with |21-25| Hamas |26-27| ; |28-28| like |29-30| Qatar |31-32| , |33-33| one |34-35| of |36-37| the |38-38| richest and most |39-43| dynamic |44-44| of the |45-45| Golf |46-46| . |47-47| 
 members |0-1| of Hamas |2-3| are |4-4| and say |5-6| that the |7-8| growing |9-9| Islamist |10-10| bends |11-12| around |13-14| Israel |15-15| from |16-17| Lebanon |18-19| , |20-20| in |21-21| the north |22-23| , where |24-25| the |26-26| Hezbollah |28-29| militia |27-27| exerts |30-30| its domination |31-32| , |33-33| via |34-36| Syria |37-38| , where |39-40| the rebels |41-42| to |43-43| Islamist |45-45| trend |44-44| can |46-46| topple |47-47| Bashar |48-48| Al @-@ Assad |49-50| , |51-51| and |52-52| up to |53-54| Jordan |55-56| , |57-57| where |58-59| Hamas |61-62| allies |60-60| threaten |63-63| the king |64-65| . |66-66| 
 and |0-0| most importantly , |1-4| on the |5-6| southern flank |7-8| of Israel |9-10| , |11-11| the rise |12-13| of the Muslim Brotherhood |14-16| under the chairmanship |17-19| of |20-20| Muhammad |21-21| Morsi |22-22| in Egypt |23-24| , |25-25| by far |26-27| the |28-28| most populous |29-30| and |31-32| most central |33-34| of the Arab countries |35-37| , |38-38| has changed |39-40| the balance |41-42| in the region |43-45| . |46-46| 
 Hosni |0-0| Mubarak |1-1| , |2-2| the |3-3| dictator who |4-5| ruled |6-7| Egypt |8-9| for 30 |10-11| years |12-12| until |13-14| his downfall |15-16| in 2011 |17-18| , |19-19| had |20-20| little time to devote |21-25| to Hamas |26-27| . |28-28| 
 by contrast |0-1| , |2-2| the Muslim Brotherhood |3-5| are |6-7| cousins |8-8| of Hamas |9-10| , |11-11| and |12-12| their leaders |13-14| rely |15-17| more easily |18-19| to public opinion |20-23| . |24-24| 
 in |0-0| future |3-3| diplomacy |1-2| , |4-4| Hamas can |5-7| emerge |8-8| as an |9-11| important |13-14| player |12-12| who |15-15| can no longer |16-18| be excluded |19-20| even |21-21| by Israel |22-23| and America |24-26| . |27-27| 
 meanwhile |0-2| , |3-3| the |4-4| hardliners |5-9| of Israel |10-11| will draw the |12-13| opposite |15-15| conclusions |14-14| . |16-16| 
 in military terms |0-2| , |3-3| Hamas |4-5| has |6-6| been |7-9| box . |10-11| 
 the |0-0| missile |4-5| interception system |1-3| called |6-6| Iron |7-7| Dome |8-8| has proved its effectiveness |9-12| and |13-13| many |14-15| Hamas |17-18| missiles |16-16| have |19-19| been |20-20| destroyed . |21-22| 
 the Israelis |0-1| will |2-2| be able to |3-3| sleep soundly at night |4-8| - |9-9| for a time |10-13| . |14-14| 
 in terms |0-1| of diplomacy |2-3| , America |4-6| renews its |7-8| unwavering support |9-10| ; |11-11| and |12-12| many European countries |13-16| have |17-17| accused |18-18| Hamas |19-20| of being |21-22| behind the |23-27| latest wave |28-29| of violence |30-31| . |32-32| 
 but above all |0-1| , Israel |2-3| has prospered |4-5| , including |6-7| under |8-8| Binyamin |9-9| Netanyahu , |10-11| the Prime |12-13| Minister |14-15| , |16-16| who |17-17| has |18-18| totally |19-19| ignored |20-20| the peace process |21-24| . |25-25| 
 although |0-1| the firing |2-3| of rockets |4-5| from Gaza |6-7| have |8-8| killed |9-9| about 30 |10-11| Israelis |12-12| since 2004 |13-14| , |15-15| Israel has |16-17| been |18-18| spared the |19-21| suicide bombings |22-23| , |24-24| including |25-27| the separation barrier |28-31| that |32-32| encroaches on |33-34| the West Bank |35-36| , the |37-38| main |40-40| chunk |39-39| of what could |41-44| be |45-45| a |46-46| Palestinian state |47-48| , |49-49| and |50-50| that protects |51-52| the |53-53| Jewish settlements |54-55| that continue |56-57| to expand |58-60| despite |61-61| their |62-62| illegality |63-63| in international law |64-68| . |69-69| 
 Mr |0-0| Netanyahu , |1-2| whose |3-4| Likud |6-6| party |5-5| merged with |7-9| an |10-10| even more |12-13| hawkish |14-14| party |11-11| , |15-15| the |16-17| leader |18-18| Avigdor |19-19| Lieberman |20-20| in the run @-@ up |21-23| to |24-24| the election |25-26| on 22 |27-28| January |29-29| , |30-30| the |32-32| party |33-33| was |31-31| beautiful |34-34| . |35-35| 
 why |0-0| spoil |1-1| the pesky |2-3| giving them a |5-8| Palestinian |4-4| state |9-9| ? |10-10| 
 if they |0-1| ran |2-2| the West Bank |3-4| , |5-5| don |6-6| &apos;t they |8-10| launch |7-7| rockets |11-12| , |13-13| as |14-14| their compatriots |15-16| did |17-19| in Gaza |20-21| ? |22-22| 
 it is |0-1| preferable to |2-3| keep them |4-5| behind |6-6| the wall |7-8| and |9-10| beat them |11-12| as soon as |13-14| they leave |15-16| the head |17-18| . |19-19| 
 maybe the |0-4| hardliners |5-9| prevail |10-11| ; |12-12| but |13-13| it may be that |14-17| the Arab Spring |18-20| makes a difference |21-23| . |24-24| 
 even if |0-1| the Islamists |2-3| who took power |4-7| in Egypt |8-9| and elsewhere |10-11| have little appreciation |12-13| Israel |14-14| , |15-15| their |16-16| priority will be |17-18| to tackle the problems |19-23| in their |24-25| own countries |26-27| . |28-28| 
 the |0-0| defence budget |1-4| of Israel |5-6| is more important |7-9| than |10-12| its four |13-14| Arab neighbours |15-16| combined . |17-18| 
 start |0-0| a war |1-2| with |3-3| the |4-4| local |6-6| superpower |5-5| will not help |7-9| the new |10-11| Arab governments |12-13| to |14-14| fix |15-15| their economies |16-17| . |18-18| 
 Mr. |0-0| Morsi |1-1| worked |2-3| with |4-4| Barack |5-5| Obama |6-6| to obtain |7-8| a |9-9| ceasefire |10-14| which |15-16| bodes well |17-20| -- |21-21| and |22-22| could mark |23-24| the beginning |25-26| of |27-27| something |28-29| . |30-30| 
 the Israelis |0-1| should also |2-3| think about |4-5| the future |6-7| . |8-8| 
 with the rest of the |0-3| Arab world |4-5| , which |6-6| is becoming |7-7| more democratic |8-9| , |10-10| deprive |11-11| the Palestinians |12-13| of their |14-15| right to |16-17| self @-@ determination |18-19| could create |20-21| a powder keg |22-23| that |24-24| is doomed |25-26| to explode |27-28| one day |29-30| in the territories |31-33| occupied by |34-35| Israel |36-36| - |37-37| a |38-38| bit like |39-40| the bus |41-42| that exploded |43-45| in Tel |46-47| Aviv |48-49| this week |50-51| . |52-52| 
 the crackdown |0-1| has already weakened |2-3| democracy |4-5| in |6-6| the |7-7| Jewish state |8-9| , |10-10| and |11-11| demography |12-13| exacerbates |14-14| the problem |15-16| as the |17-20| Arab population |21-22| increases . |23-24| 
 the |0-0| bloody |2-2| missions |1-1| against |3-3| Gaza |4-4| every two or |5-8| three years |9-10| to |11-12| Hamas |13-14| will have |15-15| a price |16-17| on the |18-19| diplomatic front |20-21| . |22-22| 
 the two |0-1| sides |2-2| need |3-4| to be |5-6| pushed by |7-8| those outside |9-12| . |13-13| 
 the answer |0-1| remains as |2-3| advocated by |4-5| the |6-6| reasonable people |7-8| found |9-12| on each side |13-15| , |16-16| and |17-17| by |18-18| most |19-20| of the |21-21| outside world |22-23| and |24-24| by |25-25| this newspaper |26-27| : |28-28| two states |29-30| , |31-31| with |32-32| a transfer |33-34| of territory |35-36| by Israel |37-38| in exchange for |39-41| security . |42-44| 
 a hope |0-1| , |2-2| small |3-3| and short @-@ |4-6| term , |7-8| is |9-9| that the |10-11| ceasefire |12-16| will provide an opportunity for |17-20| people outside |21-22| of |23-23| this cause . |24-27| 
 Egypt |0-1| , which |2-3| must now |4-5| tackle |6-7| to |8-8| halt |9-11| the flow |12-13| of arms |14-15| into Gaza |16-17| , |18-18| as well as |19-22| Turkey |23-24| and |25-25| Qatar |26-27| , |28-28| is |29-29| better placed |30-31| than ever |32-33| to persuade |34-35| Hamas |36-37| to accept |38-39| the idea |40-41| of a |42-43| Jewish state |44-45| in |46-46| the 1967 borders |47-50| with |51-51| land exchanges |52-55| and |56-56| a |57-57| shared |59-59| Jerusalem |58-58| . |60-60| 
 the Arabs |0-1| outside |4-4| countries |2-3| should also |5-6| put pressure |7-8| on |9-9| Hamas |10-11| and |12-12| Fatah |13-14| to |15-17| unite |18-19| . |20-20| 
 this would contribute |0-1| more |2-3| to |4-4| the creation |5-6| of a |7-8| Palestinian state |9-10| that |11-11| the proposal |12-13| next |14-14| to |15-15| a |16-16| pseudo @-@ |17-17| state |18-18| at |19-19| the United Nations |20-21| . |22-22| 
 Mr. |0-0| Obama |1-1| also has |2-3| a vested interest in |4-6| what |7-8| Israel |9-9| agrees to |10-11| negotiate |12-12| . |13-13| 
 during |0-2| his |3-3| first term |4-5| , |6-6| he |7-7| has not |8-10| submitted |11-11| its own |12-13| peace plan |14-16| . |17-17| 
 back at |0-2| the White House |3-6| , |7-7| it seems |8-9| equally |10-11| reluctant to |12-13| establish one . |14-17| 
 it is a |0-2| very |4-4| narrow |5-5| vision |3-3| . |6-6| 
 the stability |0-1| of the Middle |2-3| East |4-5| is a |6-7| vital |9-9| issue |8-8| for America |10-12| . |13-13| 
 this requires |0-2| a peace agreement |3-6| between Israel |7-8| and |9-9| the Palestinians |10-11| . |12-12| 
 the laws |0-1| for |2-3| cigarette |5-6| packages |4-4| neutral |7-7| came |8-9| into force |10-11| in Australia |12-13| 
 warnings |0-1| and |2-2| pictures of diseased organs |3-7| are |8-8| dark |12-12| green |11-11| packages |9-10| that are |13-14| all identical |15-16| , |17-17| regardless of |18-20| the mark |21-22| 
 this Act |0-1| came into |2-3| force |4-4| in Australia |5-6| is |7-7| a world first |8-10| , |11-11| logos |12-13| and colours |14-16| were replaced |17-19| by a |20-21| dark |24-24| olive green |22-23| and |25-25| horrific |26-27| pictures of diseased organs |28-31| and |32-32| representations |33-34| of children |35-36| and |37-38| babies |39-39| whose |40-41| illnesses were caused |42-45| by |46-46| smoking |47-48| from their parents |49-51| . |52-52| 
 outside |0-1| of the different |2-3| photos |4-4| and |5-5| health warnings |6-7| , |8-8| the only |9-10| difference between |11-12| the packages |13-14| , |15-15| since |16-16| this Saturday |17-18| , |19-19| is |20-20| the brand name |21-25| , |26-26| printed |27-27| in |28-28| small print |29-30| on |31-31| all packages |32-34| . |35-35| 
 this is the |0-3| most |5-6| stringent |7-7| regime |4-4| in the world |8-9| in terms |10-11| of |12-12| tobacco |14-15| packaging |13-13| . |16-16| 
 the |0-0| Australian federal government |1-3| said |4-5| that |6-6| the goal |7-8| was to |9-10| discourage young people |11-13| from smoking |14-15| by removing |16-17| any representation |18-19| glamour |20-20| . |21-21| 
 studies have |0-2| shown that |3-4| if |5-5| people |6-7| didn &apos;t start |8-12| smoking before |13-14| the age |15-16| of |17-17| 26 |18-18| years |19-19| , |20-20| there is a |21-23| 99 |24-24| % chance |25-27| that they |28-29| never starts |30-32| . |33-33| 
 &quot; even |0-1| when they |2-3| are |4-4| very young |5-6| , |7-7| children understand |8-10| the |11-11| message conveyed |12-13| by |14-14| tobacco |17-18| manufacturers |15-16| through |19-21| their brand image |22-25| , &quot; |26-27| said |28-30| federal |32-32| Health |33-35| Minister |31-31| , |36-36| Tanya |37-37| Plibersek |38-38| , |39-39| citing |40-41| studies that |42-44| have shown |45-46| by |47-47| example |48-48| that children |49-51| tied |52-52| the crown |53-54| logo |55-57| to |58-58| a princess |59-60| . &quot; |61-62| 
 although |0-1| Australia |2-3| has the |4-5| lowest |6-7| smoking rates |8-10| in the world |11-12| and |13-13| if |14-14| these changes |15-16| have little |17-21| impact on |22-23| the profits |24-25| of the multinationals |26-27| , |28-28| other |29-30| countries are considering |31-32| a |33-33| similar approach |34-35| . |36-36| 
 the tobacco industry |0-3| has |4-4| lobbied |5-6| against |7-7| the law |8-9| . |10-10| 
 tobacco |2-3| manufacturers |0-1| have |4-4| said |5-5| that it |6-7| would boost |8-8| the |9-9| black @-@ market trade |10-13| , which |14-15| will provide |16-16| easier access |17-19| to |20-20| cheaper cigarettes |21-24| . |25-25| 
 &quot; |0-0| adverse consequences |1-3| from |4-5| this legislation |6-7| , &quot; said |8-11| Scott |12-12| McIntyre |13-13| , |14-14| of the |15-16| British American |17-18| Tobacco Australia |19-20| . |21-21| 
 counterfeiters |0-1| in |2-2| China |3-3| and |4-5| Indonesia |6-6| will sell |7-7| more |8-9| of |10-10| counterfeit cigarettes |11-13| in |14-14| the streets |15-16| of |17-17| Australia |18-18| . |19-19| 
 others said |0-3| that the law |4-6| had |7-7| boosted |8-8| their |9-9| activity . |10-11|

 the only |0-1| problem |2-2| , experts say |3-6| , |7-7| is |8-8| the popularity |9-10| of social media |11-13| and |14-14| the |15-17| population targeted |18-19| by |20-20| the plan |21-22| . |23-23| 
 after |0-0| a series |1-2| of |3-3| Australian |5-5| laws |4-4| prohibiting |6-6| advertisements |7-8| on TV |9-11| , the |12-13| sports sponsorship |14-15| and |16-16| the obligation |17-18| for dealers |19-21| to hide |22-23| cigarettes |24-25| , |26-26| tobacco |29-30| marketing |27-28| is now available |31-34| online . |35-37| 
 Australia |0-1| has banned |2-3| advertising |4-5| on |6-6| the Web |7-8| by businesses |9-11| and |12-12| local sites |13-15| , |16-16| but it cannot |17-20| prevent |21-21| foreign sites |22-24| . |25-28| 
 &quot; if |0-1| you work |2-3| in the |4-5| tobacco |7-8| marketing |6-6| and that |9-10| you have |11-13| more than |14-15| a small |16-18| window |19-19| to promote |20-21| your products |22-23| , |24-24| the Internet |25-26| is the |27-28| place |29-30| par excellence |31-32| , &quot; said |33-36| Becky |37-37| Freeman |38-38| , |39-39| a |40-40| public health |42-44| researcher |41-41| at the University |45-47| of |48-48| Sydney |49-49| . |50-50| 
 Freeman |0-0| has |1-1| noticed |2-2| an increase in |3-5| contributions from |6-7| some |8-8| ordinary |10-10| citizens |9-9| in favour |11-12| of |13-13| brands on |14-16| social media |17-18| like YouTube |19-20| , Twitter |21-22| and Facebook |23-24| . |25-25| 
 we have to ask |0-3| whether it |4-5| is a |6-9| private citizen |10-11| who |12-12| loves |13-13| the |14-14| Marlboro cigarettes |15-16| and |17-17| who |18-18| took the trouble |19-23| to make |24-25| a video |26-27| , |28-28| or |29-29| if it |30-31| is a |32-35| marketing |37-37| campaign |36-36| orchestrated by |38-39| an agency |40-41| ? |42-42| 
 British American |0-1| Tobacco Australia |2-3| said |4-5| that |6-6| the industry |7-8| is focused |9-10| on |11-11| the new regulations |12-14| in force |15-16| rather than |17-18| on |19-19| marketing |20-21| . |22-22| 
 the industry |0-1| has gone |2-3| up to |4-5| pay |6-6| Ukraine |7-8| , |9-9| Honduras |10-11| and |12-12| the |13-13| Dominican |15-15| Republic |14-14| to challenge |16-17| these new |18-19| court decisions |20-22| - |23-23| these |24-24| countries have |25-26| reported to |27-28| WHO |29-30| that trade |31-33| is |34-34| unfairly |35-35| disadvantaged |36-36| , |37-37| although |38-39| none of |40-41| these countries |42-43| has had |44-46| significant |47-48| trade with |49-51| Australia |52-53| . |54-54| 
 a |0-0| WTO decision |1-4| should |5-5| be taken |6-7| in |8-8| the course of |9-11| the year |12-13| 2013 |14-14| . |15-15| 
 Plibersek |0-0| said |1-2| that |3-3| the government |4-5| had held |6-7| discussions |8-9| with other countries |10-13| on |14-14| similar laws |15-17| on the packaging |18-20| . |21-21| 
 Canada |0-1| was |2-3| the first country to |4-7| make mandatory |8-9| the |10-10| warning |12-13| pictures |11-11| on the packaging |14-16| in 2001 |17-18| . |19-19| 
 at |0-0| present |1-1| , |2-2| these warnings |3-4| are present |5-6| in |7-7| 40 countries |8-9| , |10-10| including Brazil |11-13| , |14-14| Turkey |15-16| and |17-17| Ukraine |18-19| . |20-20| 
 tougher |2-3| laws |0-1| are |4-4| currently under consideration |5-8| in England |9-10| , New |11-12| Zealand |13-14| , |15-15| South Africa |16-18| and |19-19| India |20-20| . |21-21| 
 many smokers |0-2| in Australia |3-4| remain |5-5| insensitive |6-6| to these |7-8| photos |9-9| . |10-10| 
 the photos |0-1| do |2-2| not |5-5| bother me |3-4| . |6-6| 
 I |0-1| don &apos;t know |2-2| . |3-3| 
 &quot; |0-0| you take |1-2| a cigarette |3-4| and |5-5| you put |6-7| the package |8-9| , &quot; said |10-13| Victor |14-14| El |15-15| Hage |16-16| when buying |17-20| a package |21-22| that |23-24| included |25-25| a photo |26-27| of |28-28| cancer |29-29| of the |30-31| mouth |32-32| . |33-33| 
 to be frank |0-2| , |3-3| the only |4-5| reason I |6-8| will |9-9| stop |10-10| , |11-11| this is |12-13| my |14-14| little girl |15-16| . |17-17| 
 James |0-0| Yu |1-1| , |2-2| manager of the |3-4| &quot; |5-5| King of the |6-8| Pack |9-9| tobacconist |10-10| &quot; in |11-12| the centre |13-14| of |15-15| Sydney |16-16| , |17-17| said |18-19| that |20-20| the uniformity |21-22| of packaging |23-24| made it difficult |25-26| stowing |27-28| packages |29-30| on the |31-32| shelves . |33-34| 
 &quot; before |0-1| , |2-2| I needed |3-5| an hour |6-7| to unload |8-9| a package |10-11| , |12-12| now it |13-15| takes me |16-17| four hours |18-19| , &quot; |20-20| said |21-22| Yu |23-23| . |24-24| 
 &quot; |0-0| the government |1-2| had only |3-5| to |6-6| ban them |7-8| once and for all |9-13| and |14-14| we would have |15-16| said |17-17| OK |18-18| , |19-19| that &apos;s |20-21| good |22-22| , |23-23| you stop |24-25| and |26-26| you put |27-28| the key |29-30| in |31-31| the door |32-33| , &quot; |34-35| he |36-40| added |41-41| , |42-43| raising their arms to the |44-47| sky . |48-49| 
 in |0-0| a world |1-2| constantly |3-3| connected |4-4| , |5-5| it may |6-7| be |8-8| good |9-9| to get bored |10-12| . |13-13| 
 I spent |0-2| five hours |3-4| at an airport |5-7| during |8-8| the period |9-10| from |11-11| Thanksgiving , |12-13| because |14-14| our plane |15-16| had |17-17| mechanical problems |18-20| and |21-21| we had to |22-24| wait for |25-25| the arrival |26-27| of another |28-30| plane |31-31| . |32-32| 
 therefore |0-1| , I had |2-5| enough time to |6-9| reflect on the |10-11| theme of |12-13| boredom |14-15| . |16-16| 
 I |0-0| am not going to |1-4| lie . |5-6| 
 spend |0-0| half a day |1-4| in |5-5| an airport |6-7| waiting for |8-9| a flight |10-11| is quite |12-13| boring |14-14| , |15-15| even when |16-17| you have |18-19| books |20-21| , magazines and |22-26| iPhones |27-27| to |28-28| distract you |29-30| ( |31-31| not to mention |32-33| the |34-34| duty @-@ free |37-39| shops |35-36| ) |40-40| . |41-41| 
 but |0-0| increasingly |1-4| , |5-5| some academics |6-7| and |8-8| experts in |9-11| child development |12-16| praise |17-19| of |20-20| boredom |21-22| . |23-23| 
 it is |0-1| perfectly normal |2-3| for us |4-5| - |6-6| and |7-7| our children |8-9| - |10-11| bored |12-13| from time to time |14-17| , they say |18-21| . |22-22| 
 this forces |0-1| the brain |2-3| to |4-4| take |5-7| interesting |8-8| , or even |9-10| to foster creativity |11-14| . |15-15| 
 and |0-0| as |1-1| we are |2-3| , |4-4| for the most part , |5-8| constantly |9-9| in front of |10-10| several |11-11| types of |12-13| screens , |14-15| we know |16-18| the |19-20| benefits of |21-22| boredom |23-24| . |25-25| 
 should we |0-3| welcome |4-4| the boredom |5-6| with open arms |7-9| ? |10-10| 
 yes |0-0| . &quot; |1-1| 
 and not |0-1| . |2-2| 
 but |0-0| I will come back to |1-3| . |4-4| 
 first of all |0-2| , like |3-7| many people |8-10| , |11-11| I thought |12-13| that |14-14| boredom |15-16| was a |17-18| rather recent |20-21| phenomenon |19-19| , especially |22-23| since |24-25| we have |26-27| more free time |28-31| . |32-32| 
 but that is not |0-4| the case |5-6| , &quot; says |7-8| Peter |9-9| Toohey |10-10| , |11-11| Greco @-@ Roman |15-17| history professor |12-14| at the University |18-20| of Calgary |21-22| , Canada |23-25| , |26-26| and |27-27| author |28-28| of &quot; boredom |29-31| : a |32-33| Lively |34-34| History |35-35| &quot; ( |36-37| Yale |38-38| University Press |39-40| , |41-41| 2011 |42-42| ) |43-43| . |44-44| 
 &quot; |0-0| the trouble |1-2| was |3-4| very |5-5| far away |6-6| , &quot; he said |7-11| . |12-12| 
 on |0-0| the walls |1-2| of |3-3| Pompeii |4-4| are |5-5| Latin |8-8| graffiti |6-7| that evoke |9-10| the boredom |11-12| , they |13-14| date back |15-15| to the first |16-17| century |18-18| . |19-19| 
 then there is |0-4| the definition |5-6| that |7-7| we give |8-9| to |10-10| boredom |11-12| . |13-13| 
 the problem |0-1| is |2-2| that it |3-4| has |5-5| been |6-6| defined |7-7| , |8-8| and debated |9-10| , |11-11| in different ways |12-14| , |15-15| &quot; said |16-17| John |18-18| D. |19-19| Eastwood , |20-21| associate professor |22-23| of psychology |24-25| at York |26-28| University |29-29| in |30-30| Ontario |31-32| , |33-33| Canada |34-34| . |35-35| 
 after |0-2| numerous |3-4| publications and |5-6| submitted |7-7| the idea |8-9| in a focus group |10-14| of about |15-16| 100 people |17-18| , |19-19| Professor |20-21| Eastwood |22-22| and |23-23| his colleagues |24-25| have defined |26-27| boredom |28-29| as |30-31| an experience that |32-34| is |35-35| &quot; |36-36| to want to |37-38| do something |39-41| , |42-42| but |43-43| without |44-44| reaching |45-46| a |47-50| satisfactory |52-52| activity |51-51| . &quot; |53-54| 
 what differentiates |0-2| the boredom |3-4| of |5-5| apathy |6-7| , |8-8| he says |9-11| , |12-12| is that |13-15| the person |16-17| is not |18-20| undertaking |21-24| a task |25-26| well as it would like |27-31| . |32-32| 
 with |0-0| apathy |1-2| , |3-3| he said |4-6| , |7-7| there is no |8-12| desire |13-14| to do something |15-18| . |19-19| 
 what |0-1| is |2-2| at the heart |3-4| of |5-5| the problem |6-7| , |8-8| he |9-13| said |14-14| , |15-15| it is |16-17| &quot; |18-18| the interruption |19-20| of the process |21-22| of attention |23-24| , |25-25| coupled with |26-27| a low mood |28-30| and |31-31| feel that |32-34| time passes |35-37| slowly |38-38| . &quot; |39-40| 
 boredom |0-1| can |2-2| strongly |3-3| resemble |4-5| a depression |6-7| . |8-8| 
 but |0-0| Professor |1-2| Eastwood |3-3| said |4-5| that if |6-7| the two |8-9| may be |10-11| related |12-12| , people who |13-16| are bored |17-18| tend |19-20| to think |21-22| that |23-23| the problem |24-25| stems from |26-27| the environment |28-29| or the |30-31| world , |32-33| while |34-35| the |36-36| depressed |38-38| people |37-37| believe that |39-40| the |41-41| problem is |42-43| . |44-46| 
 sometimes |0-0| , |1-1| we may |2-5| think that |6-7| we |8-9| &apos;re bored |10-10| while he |11-13| is in fact |14-18| a problem |19-20| of concentration |21-22| . |23-23| 
 in their |0-4| study , |5-6| &quot; The |7-8| Unengaged |9-9| Mind |10-10| : defining |11-12| boredom |13-13| in Terms |14-15| of Attention |16-17| , &quot; |18-19| which |20-20| was |21-22| published in |23-24| the |25-25| journal |26-26| Perspectives on |27-29| Psychological Science |30-31| &quot; |32-32| in September |33-34| , |35-35| Professor |36-37| Eastwood |38-38| and |39-39| his colleagues |40-41| have highlighted |42-45| an |46-46| earlier |48-49| experiment |47-47| in which |50-51| participants |52-53| listened to |54-54| on tape |55-56| , |57-57| the voice |58-59| of a person |60-62| reading |63-66| a magazine article |67-70| . |71-71| 
 some groups |0-1| have |2-2| heard |3-3| from |4-7| the room |8-9| next door |10-11| , |12-12| the sound |13-14| too high |15-16| of a |17-18| TV show |19-21| that |22-22| had no |23-25| report , |26-27| others have |28-30| just |31-32| heard the |33-34| TV show |35-37| , |38-38| and |39-39| the |40-40| third group |41-42| did |43-44| not |45-47| hear |48-48| the |49-49| soundtrack |50-52| . |53-53| 
 those who |0-1| heard |2-3| the |4-4| TV |5-5| to |6-6| low noise level |7-10| said they |11-14| had |15-16| more |17-17| annoyed |18-18| than the other two |19-22| groups - |23-24| they |25-25| have found it difficult to |26-30| concentrate |31-32| , |33-33| but |34-34| did not know |35-37| why |38-38| , |39-39| and |40-40| attributed |41-42| the problem |43-44| of concentration |45-46| to |47-47| boredom |48-49| . |50-50| 
 when you |0-1| try to concentrate |2-5| on |6-6| a difficult task |7-9| or |10-10| involved |11-11| , |12-12| an interruption |13-14| of |15-15| attention |16-17| can |18-18| lead to |19-20| boredom |21-22| , |23-23| said |24-25| Mark |26-26| J. |27-27| Fenske , |28-29| an |30-30| associate professor |31-32| of |33-33| neuroscience |34-34| at the |35-36| University of |37-38| Guelph |39-39| in |40-40| Ontario |41-42| and |43-43| one of the authors of |44-48| the study |49-50| . |51-51| 
 on the other hand |0-1| , |2-2| when you make |3-5| a |6-6| boring task |7-8| , |9-9| &quot; |10-10| like watching |11-12| objects |13-14| on |15-15| an assembly line |16-19| , music |20-22| can |23-23| help you |24-26| do not get bored |27-30| . &quot; |31-32| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| he says |3-5| , |6-6| now |7-8| , |9-9| we know |10-11| that |12-12| when |13-14| wiggles |15-16| or |17-19| scribble , |20-21| these gestures |22-23| , often |24-25| seen as |26-27| signs of |28-30| boredom |31-31| , |32-32| are |33-35| a good |36-37| way to stay |38-40| physically |41-41| more |42-42| alert . |43-44| 
 &quot; |0-0| studies have shown |1-4| that children who |5-8| are |9-9| allowed to |10-11| wriggling |12-12| learn |13-13| more |14-14| and |15-15| retain |16-16| more information than |17-20| those who |21-22| are forced |23-24| to remain |25-26| motionless |27-28| , &quot; said |29-32| Professor |33-34| Fenske |35-35| . |36-36| 
 we |0-0| all |3-3| we &apos;re bored |1-2| one day |4-5| or |6-6| another |7-8| - |9-9| the delay |10-11| of my |12-13| airplane |15-16| flight |14-14| , |17-17| a speaker |18-19| with |20-20| a |21-21| monotonous |23-23| voice |22-22| , |24-24| a film |25-26| particularly |27-27| boring . |28-29| 
 but |0-0| some people |1-2| are more |3-4| likely to |5-6| be bored |7-8| than others . |9-12| 
 to measure |0-1| this , |2-3| researchers |4-5| have developed |6-7| a |8-8| &quot; |9-9| Scale |10-11| predisposition to |12-13| boredom |14-15| &quot; |16-16| in the 1980s |17-20| . |21-21| 
 the scale |0-1| includes |2-3| statements |4-4| such as |5-5| , |6-6| &quot; |7-7| Among the |8-9| tasks |10-10| that |11-11| I make |12-13| , |14-14| many of them |15-18| are |19-19| repetitive and monotonous |20-22| , &quot; |23-24| and &quot; |25-26| I have |27-28| so many |29-30| points of interest |31-33| that |34-34| I do not have |35-38| the time to |39-41| do everything |42-43| . &quot; |44-45| 
 using |0-1| such a |2-3| scale , |4-5| the researchers found |6-9| that |10-10| boys |11-12| tend |13-14| to miss |15-17| more often than |18-20| girls |21-22| , |23-23| &quot; said |24-25| Stephen |26-26| Vodanovich |27-27| , |28-28| a |29-29| professor of |30-31| psychology at |32-33| the |34-34| University of |35-36| West |37-37| Florida |38-38| , |39-39| and |40-41| in particular |42-42| need |43-43| of |44-44| many and varied |46-48| stimuli |45-45| . |49-49| 
 but |0-0| in general |1-2| , |3-3| adolescents |4-5| are |6-6| quickly |7-7| blase |8-8| . |9-9| 
 in 1991 |0-1| , |2-2| Reed |3-3| Larson |4-4| , |5-5| a professor |6-7| in |8-8| individual and community development |9-12| at |13-13| the |14-14| University of |15-16| Illinois |17-17| , |18-18| conducted an |19-21| experiment in which |22-26| he contacted |27-29| nearly |30-31| 400 |32-32| teenagers |33-33| and |34-34| their parents |35-36| seven |37-37| to eight |38-39| times a |40-41| day |42-42| via |43-43| a |44-44| beeper |45-45| . |46-46| 
 he |0-0| noted |1-2| that |3-3| 32 |4-4| percent |5-6| of teenagers reported being |7-9| bored |10-11| at school |12-14| and during |15-16| their |17-17| homework |18-21| , |22-22| while |23-24| 23 |25-25| percent |26-27| said they |28-28| get bored |29-30| when they |31-32| were not |33-35| in school |36-38| . |39-39| 
 in contrast |0-1| , |2-2| 3 |3-3| percent |4-5| of parents |6-7| reported |8-9| bored |10-11| . |12-12| 
 Professor |0-1| Larson |2-2| said he |3-6| did not know |7-9| if |10-10| the percentages |11-12| of boredom |13-14| of today |15-17| , |18-19| 21 |20-20| years later |21-23| , |24-24| would be |25-25| higher |26-27| or |28-28| lower . |29-30| 
 but |0-0| he added |1-3| that he |4-5| knew |6-7| &quot; |8-8| adolescence |9-10| is |11-11| a period |12-13| where |14-14| boredom |15-16| reached its |17-18| highest level |19-21| , &quot; |22-23| particularly |24-24| because |25-26| children |27-28| and |29-29| adolescents |30-31| do not have much |32-36| control over |37-38| what they |39-41| want to do |42-43| . |44-44| 
 if I |0-1| based |2-2| my question |3-4| : |5-5| boredom |6-7| is it |8-10| good for |11-12| you |13-13| ? |14-14| 
 sometimes |0-0| not |1-1| , because |2-3| in its |4-5| extreme form |6-7| , it |8-9| can cause |10-11| people |12-13| to |14-14| take |15-16| physical risks |17-18| absurd |19-19| , |20-20| make |21-22| bets |23-23| or |24-24| abusing |25-26| substances |27-28| to pass the time |29-32| , |33-33| as |34-34| the |37-37| studies |35-36| show |38-38| . |39-39| 
 however |0-1| , |2-2| many |3-4| philosophers |5-5| and writers |6-7| suggest |8-8| a link |9-10| between |11-11| boredom |12-13| and |14-14| creativity |15-16| , |17-17| &quot; said |18-19| Professor |20-21| Vodanovich |22-22| , |23-23| who is studying |24-25| the issue |26-27| for more than |28-30| two |31-31| decades |32-32| . |33-33| 
 &quot; |0-0| the problem |1-2| is the |3-4| way |5-5| that |6-6| the brain |7-8| found |9-10| to |11-11| inform you |12-14| that |15-15| you should |16-17| do something else |18-20| , &quot; said |21-24| Gary |25-25| Marcus |26-26| , |27-27| a |28-28| professor of |29-30| psychology at |31-32| the |33-33| N.Y.U. |34-34| 
 but |0-0| the brain |1-2| does |3-3| not always know |4-6| what is the |7-9| most appropriate |11-13| thing |10-10| to do |14-15| . |16-16| 
 if |0-0| you are bored |1-3| and |4-4| you use |5-7| this energy |8-9| to |10-10| play the guitar |11-14| and |15-15| cook |16-16| , this |17-18| will make you |19-20| happy . |21-22| 
 but if |0-1| you look at |2-3| the |4-4| TV , |5-6| it |7-7| will make you |8-9| happy |10-10| in the short |11-12| term , |13-14| but not |15-16| in the long |17-18| term . |19-20| 
 so if |0-1| your child |2-3| is bored |4-5| and give him |6-10| an iPad |11-12| , |13-13| he |14-15| will miss |16-17| most |18-18| , |19-19| but |20-20| he |21-21| has not |22-24| learned to |25-26| handle |27-28| alone |29-30| or |31-32| if |33-33| autorégler |34-34| , |35-35| says |36-36| Professor |37-38| Fenske |39-39| . |40-40| 
 and &quot; |0-1| this |2-2| autorèglement |3-3| passes from |4-5| one situation to |6-8| another |9-10| , &quot; |11-12| he says |13-17| . |18-18| 
 your |0-0| child |1-2| learns |3-3| not |4-4| only |5-5| to |6-6| entertain |7-8| , |9-9| he |10-10| gets |11-11| more |12-13| control of |14-15| himself |16-18| in other areas |19-22| . |23-23| 
 I |0-0| don &apos;t think |1-4| we should |5-6| glorify |7-7| the boredom |8-9| . |10-10| 
 just as |0-1| I |2-2| do not think |3-7| that |8-8| we should |9-10| criticize |11-12| . |13-13| 
 feel comfortable |0-4| outside the |5-7| constant |9-9| ferment |8-8| generated by |10-11| the activities |12-13| and |14-14| the technology |15-16| is |17-17| the goal |18-19| towards which |20-21| we should |22-23| strive for . |24-25| 
 Professor |0-1| Eastwood |2-2| agrees |3-5| on |6-6| this point |7-8| . |9-9| 
 &quot; |0-0| we need |1-3| to |4-4| bore |6-6| us |5-5| more often |7-8| , |9-9| but |10-10| boredom |11-12| awakens |13-13| an |14-14| acute |16-16| and |17-17| frenetic |18-18| desire |15-15| to be |19-20| connected to |21-22| something |23-24| that makes sense |25-28| , &quot; |29-30| he |31-35| said . |36-37| 
 according to him |0-1| , |2-2| what people |3-6| are looking for |7-7| is |8-10| a way to |11-13| disconnect |14-15| and enjoy |16-18| the |19-19| downtime |20-22| . |23-23| 
 &quot; in |0-1| an environment |2-3| where |4-4| we are |5-6| constantly |7-7| hyperstimulés |8-8| , &quot; |9-10| he |11-15| added |16-16| , |17-17| &quot; |18-18| it is |19-20| difficult to |21-22| find ways to |23-26| engage in |27-29| something |30-31| when |32-32| the noise |33-34| stops |35-36| . &quot; |37-38| 
 in |0-0| Colorado |1-2| , |3-3| no directive |4-5| for the |6-7| new law |8-9| on |10-10| marijuana |11-12| 
 Anthony |0-0| Orozco |1-1| , |2-2| 19 |3-4| , a student |5-6| at a university |7-9| and |10-10| football |12-13| player |11-11| in |14-14| Colorado |15-16| , |17-17| is |18-18| indicted for |19-20| something that |21-23| will soon become |24-25| legal in |26-27| his state |28-29| : |30-30| pellet |33-34| possession |31-32| of marijuana and |35-38| a pipe |39-40| used |41-41| for |42-43| smoking |44-44| . |45-45| 
 Mr. |0-0| Orozco |1-1| said |2-3| that one day |4-7| in September |8-9| , |10-10| he and |11-12| some friends |13-14| were |15-16| in a car |17-21| at |22-22| Lamar |23-23| , |24-24| in the middle |25-26| of the |27-27| field , |28-29| near |30-31| the border |32-33| with Kansas |34-36| , |37-37| when they |38-39| were arrested |40-42| . |43-43| 
 after |0-1| the police officer |2-5| found |6-7| marijuana |8-9| in |10-10| the car |11-12| , |13-13| Mr. |14-14| Orozco |15-15| received a |16-18| summons |19-21| for possession |22-23| of |24-24| drugs and |25-26| equipment that could be used |27-29| to |30-30| its consumption |31-32| - |33-33| minor offences |34-36| , each |37-38| with |39-41| a $ 100 fine |42-46| - |47-47| and |48-48| a court date |49-52| . |53-53| 
 &quot; |0-0| we are |1-2| treated like |3-4| criminals |5-6| , &quot; said |7-10| Mr. |11-11| Orozco |12-12| . |13-13| 
 but |0-0| is |1-2| there a |3-5| ? |6-6| 
 during |0-0| the weeks |1-2| of uncertainty |3-4| that followed |5-7| the vote |8-9| of Colorado |10-11| to |12-12| legalize |13-13| the consumption |14-15| of small amounts of marijuana |16-20| for personal use |21-24| , |25-25| the response |26-28| to |29-29| hundreds |30-31| of |32-32| cases involving |33-34| a small |35-36| drug |38-39| use |37-37| depends more on the |40-42| place |43-44| of |45-45| the law |46-47| . |48-48| 
 here and |0-1| in |2-2| Washington |3-6| , which |7-8| adopted a |9-11| similar measure |12-13| , |14-14| hundreds |15-16| of crimes |17-18| involving |19-19| the use |20-21| of marijuana |22-23| were |24-25| discontinued |26-28| . |29-29| 
 the police |0-3| have |4-4| ceased to |5-6| indict |7-7| adults |8-9| aged 21 or older |10-14| for |15-15| minor |17-17| possession |16-16| of marijuana |18-19| , because |20-21| the law |22-23| will come into |24-25| force |26-26| in the coming weeks |27-31| . |32-32| 
 but |0-0| prosecutors |1-2| who are in |3-6| the |7-7| more conservative |9-10| districts |8-8| of Colorado |11-12| called for |13-15| speeding up |16-16| the |17-17| existing |21-21| marijuana |19-20| cases |18-18| and continue |22-23| to charge |24-25| those |26-27| who |28-29| possess |30-30| . |31-31| 
 at the same time , |0-1| several |2-2| cities in the |3-4| suburbs of |5-6| Denver |7-7| to the |8-9| mountains of |10-11| western |12-13| currently |15-15| vote |14-14| to prevent |16-17| the opening |18-19| of |20-20| shops |21-21| selling |22-23| marijuana |24-25| approved by |26-27| the State |28-29| in their |30-31| neighbourhoods . |32-33| 
 &quot; |0-0| things |1-2| are changing |3-3| so rapidly |4-5| that |6-6| I don |7-8| &apos;t know |9-10| what |11-12| the future holds |13-16| , &quot; said |17-20| Daniel |21-21| J. |22-22| Oates , |23-24| the police chief |25-29| in |30-30| Aurora , |31-32| east of |33-36| Denver |37-37| . |38-38| 
 regulators in |0-4| Washington |5-8| are |9-10| also |11-11| quite a lot |12-13| of questions |14-15| . |16-16| 
 they are |0-1| looking for |2-4| guidance |5-5| on how to |6-9| install a |10-11| permit system , |12-15| allowing them to |16-17| produce , manufacture |18-20| , |21-21| distribute |22-22| and |23-23| sell |24-24| - |25-25| before |26-26| the deadline of |27-30| December 1 , |31-32| 2013 |33-33| . |34-34| 
 they say |0-1| that the |2-3| Colorado |4-4| , |5-5| whether we like it |6-9| or not , |10-12| is ahead of |13-16| most states |17-20| in regulation |21-24| on |25-25| marijuana |26-27| , |28-28| firstly |29-31| on the |32-33| Therapeutic Use |34-38| and now |39-40| with regard to |41-44| personal use |45-47| . |48-48| 
 &quot; |0-0| Colorado |1-2| has |3-3| a |4-4| more regulated |6-7| market |5-5| , |8-8| and |9-9| is a |10-11| good indicator |12-13| , &quot; said |14-17| Brian |18-18| E. |19-19| Smith |20-20| , |21-21| spokesman for the |22-25| Washington State |26-27| Liquor Control Board |28-30| . |31-31| 
 but |0-0| no place |1-2| or |3-3| system , |4-5| recognizes |6-6| Mr. |7-7| Smith |8-8| , |9-9| cannot |10-11| do more |12-13| than |14-14| suggest |15-15| what works |16-18| . |19-19| 
 &quot; |0-0| there is |1-4| no real |5-7| precedent |8-8| on which |9-10| we could |11-13| base |14-14| , |15-15| &quot; he |16-20| said |21-21| . |22-22| 
 Washington |3-3| &apos;s law |0-2| , which |4-5| is called |6-7| I @-@ |8-9| 502 |10-10| , |11-11| takes effect |12-13| on December 6 |14-16| , leaving |17-20| a gap |21-23| of a |24-25| year , |26-27| during which |28-29| the permit system |30-33| does |34-34| not yet |36-37| exist |35-35| , |38-38| while |39-40| the possession |41-42| of marijuana |43-44| will be |45-45| legal . |46-47| 
 meanwhile |0-2| , |3-3| practical issues |4-6| remain unresolved |7-9| : how to |10-11| balance the |12-13| state |16-17| &apos;s mandate |14-15| that ensures |18-19| adequate access |20-22| to |23-23| licensed |26-26| marijuana |24-25| and |27-27| prohibits |28-28| the installation |29-30| of |31-31| cannabis |35-36| outlets |32-34| in a |37-38| 30 km radius around |39-43| a school , |44-48| a park |49-50| , |51-51| a |52-53| playground |54-56| or |57-58| a nursery |59-60| . |61-61| 
 &quot; |0-0| there will be |1-4| no |5-6| more difficult |8-9| places |7-7| that |10-10| urban areas |11-13| to install |14-15| a |16-16| cannabis |21-22| sales |19-20| registered trade |17-18| , |23-23| particularly in |24-25| the |26-26| Seattle |30-30| metropolitan area |27-29| , &quot; said |31-34| Ben |35-35| Livingston |36-36| , |37-37| a |38-38| spokesman for the |39-42| Centre for |43-44| legalization |45-45| of cannabis |46-47| , |48-48| a research group |49-52| recently |53-53| formed . |54-55| 
 on 21 |0-1| November |2-2| , the |3-4| police chief |5-8| , |9-9| Oates |10-10| , |11-12| Aurora , |13-14| sent |15-16| an e |17-18| @-@ mail |19-20| to |21-21| his officers |22-23| announcing |24-24| that the |25-26| &quot; |27-27| City |28-28| attorney |29-29| &quot; ( |30-31| representative of the |32-33| Public Prosecutor |34-35| ) |36-36| would |37-37| continue |38-38| more |39-39| people |40-41| aged 21 or older |42-46| possessing |47-48| small amounts |49-51| of marijuana |52-53| , |54-54| and that |55-56| the police |57-58| should |59-59| cease to |60-61| charge people for |62-65| this type |66-67| of |68-68| offence |69-69| &quot; |70-70| with |71-71| immediate effect |72-73| . &quot; |74-75| 
 Chief |0-1| Oates |2-2| said |3-4| that |5-5| the police |6-7| would apply the |8-9| new |10-10| court decisions |11-13| that regulate |14-15| the activity |16-17| of |18-18| those |19-19| who cultivate |20-21| marijuana |22-23| for medical purposes |24-27| , |28-28| and |29-29| that it |30-31| would continue |32-32| to pursue |33-34| drug traffickers |35-38| and |39-39| dealers |40-41| . |42-42| 
 in |0-0| Weld County |1-2| in northern |3-6| Colorado |7-8| , |9-9| &quot; the |10-11| district |12-12| attorney |13-13| &quot; ( |14-15| prosecutor |16-19| ) |20-20| , |21-21| Ken |22-22| Buck |23-23| , |24-24| embodies a |25-26| stricter |28-29| vision |27-27| . |30-30| 
 after |0-0| the vote |1-2| , |3-3| he said that |4-7| his office |8-9| would continue |10-10| to handle the cases |11-15| of |16-16| possession |17-17| of marijuana |18-19| , mainly |20-21| in order to |22-23| put pressure |24-25| on |26-26| users |27-28| to |29-29| seek |30-33| treatment . |34-35| 
 at the moment |0-3| , |4-4| 119 |5-5| people were |6-7| charged with |8-9| possession of |10-11| 56 |12-12| grams |13-13| or less |14-15| of marijuana |16-17| , |18-18| but |19-19| many of them |20-23| are |24-26| other |27-28| charges |29-29| . |30-30| 
 &quot; |0-0| our office |1-2| has |3-3| the obligation |4-5| to take legal action against |6-10| those |11-11| persons who |12-13| have committed |14-15| an offence |16-17| which , |18-19| at the time |20-22| of the facts |23-24| , |25-25| was a |26-27| recognized offence |28-29| , &quot; said |30-33| Mr. |34-34| Buck |35-35| . |36-36| 
 the reactions |0-1| were |2-3| complicated , |4-4| even in |5-7| rural |9-9| areas |8-8| such as |10-10| Mesa |11-11| County |12-12| , where |13-14| voters |15-16| rejected |17-18| the initiative |19-20| for |21-23| the |24-24| limited |26-26| use |25-25| of marijuana |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the police |0-1| in Grand |2-3| Junction |4-4| , |5-5| the largest city in the |6-10| county |11-11| , |12-12| is no longer |13-15| appear |16-16| adults |17-18| for possession |19-20| of |21-21| small |23-23| quantities |22-22| . |24-24| 
 the representative |0-1| of the |2-2| public prosecutor |3-4| in the county |5-6| , Pete |7-8| Hautzinger |9-9| , |10-10| argued |11-12| that decision |13-14| , |15-15| but |16-16| also decided |17-19| not to |20-22| drop |23-25| all cases |26-28| of |29-29| possession of marijuana |30-32| . |33-33| 
 &quot; |0-0| I did not |1-4| seem to |5-7| waste my time |8-10| to continue |11-12| to apply |13-14| the law |15-16| until |17-20| it changes |21-22| , &quot; |23-24| he |25-29| said . |30-31| 
 although |0-1| 55 |2-2| percent of |3-4| Colorado |6-7| voters |5-5| have |8-8| supported |9-9| the measure |10-11| , |12-12| provide an |13-14| appropriate government |18-19| and legal framework |15-17| for |20-20| personal |23-23| consumption |21-22| of marijuana |24-25| is not easy |26-30| . |31-31| 
 and |0-0| the |1-1| conflicting |3-4| reactions |2-2| were observed |5-7| in various |8-9| U.S. cities |10-11| highlight |12-14| the deep |15-16| ambivalence |17-17| among |18-18| local officials |19-21| regarding |22-25| the legalization |26-27| of |28-28| marijuana |29-30| . |31-31| 
 &quot; |0-0| this is a |1-5| cultural barrier |6-7| &quot; |8-8| with |9-9| the representatives |10-11| of the |12-12| public prosecutor |13-14| , |15-15| said |16-17| Sean |18-18| McAllister |19-19| , |20-20| a lawyer |21-22| in Denver |23-24| representing |25-26| people accused |27-29| of marijuana use |30-33| and |34-34| expressed |35-37| as a |38-40| local |44-44| spokesman |41-43| for the National |45-48| Organization for the |49-51| Reform |52-52| of Marijuana |53-54| Laws |55-55| &quot; ( |56-57| National Organization |58-59| for the Reform |60-62| of |63-63| Marijuana |66-67| Laws |64-65| ) |68-68| . |69-69| 
 &quot; |0-0| they spent |1-3| much of |4-7| their lives |8-9| to |10-10| prosecute |11-13| people |14-15| who used marijuana |16-20| , |21-21| too , |22-23| they |24-26| find it difficult |27-28| to accept |29-30| that this |31-32| is legal |33-34| , &quot; |35-36| he |37-41| said . |42-43| 
 as the first |0-3| states |4-4| to |5-5| deal with the |6-7| limited |9-9| use |8-8| of marijuana |10-11| at the same level as |12-15| that of |16-17| alcohol |18-19| , |20-20| Colorado |21-22| and |23-23| Washington |24-27| are |28-28| becoming a |29-33| case law |34-36| for |37-37| the legalization |38-39| of drugs |40-41| . |42-42| 
 while |0-1| advocates |2-3| and |4-5| state officials |6-9| are planning |10-10| a new frontier |11-13| of |14-14| legalized |16-16| sales |15-15| , |17-17| they look |18-19| with concern |20-21| the |22-22| guidelines of the |23-24| federal government |25-26| , which |27-28| is |29-29| always |30-30| the sale |31-32| and cultivation of |33-36| marijuana |37-37| as |38-39| federal |41-41| crimes |40-40| . |42-42| 
 advocates of |0-2| legalization |3-4| of |5-5| marijuana |6-7| are hoping |8-8| that the |9-10| Ministry of |11-12| Justice |13-14| will sell |15-15| . |16-16| 
 despite some |0-1| high @-@ profile |3-3| arrests |2-2| of |4-4| patients on |5-6| medical |8-8| marijuana |7-7| and |9-10| sellers |11-11| , the |12-13| federal government |14-15| has enabled |16-19| businesses |20-20| for |21-21| sale |22-22| of marijuana |23-24| for therapeutic purposes |25-28| to exercise |29-30| in |31-31| Colorado |32-33| , |34-34| in Washington |35-36| and |37-37| in 16 |38-39| other states |40-41| . |42-42| 
 if it |0-1| is |2-2| true that |3-4| the police |5-6| is unlikely to |7-10| push |11-11| the doors |12-13| to capture |14-15| small |16-17| packets of |18-19| drugs , |20-21| it is |22-24| highly likely |25-27| that it |28-29| opposes the |30-32| licensed |34-34| shops |33-33| selling |35-37| marijuana |38-38| for |39-39| personal use , |40-41| authorized by |42-43| the new laws |44-46| , |47-47| &quot; said |48-49| Kevin |50-50| A. |51-51| Sabet |52-52| , |53-53| a former |54-55| political adviser |56-57| to |58-58| the Obama administration |59-61| . |62-62| 
 many |0-1| Colorado |3-4| cities |2-2| did |5-6| not wait for |7-9| the |10-10| federal authorities |11-12| act |13-13| . |14-14| 
 before |0-1| the vote |2-3| , some |4-5| local governments |6-7| have |8-8| approved |9-9| moratoriums |10-11| on |12-12| the creation |13-14| of new |15-16| businesses |17-17| for |18-18| sale |19-19| of marijuana |20-21| , even |22-23| if it |24-25| is only |26-30| a year &apos;s delay |31-35| . |36-36| 
last week |0-2| , |3-3| the town |4-5| of |6-6| Montrose |7-7| received |8-9| a |10-10| six @-@ month |12-14| moratorium |11-11| , |15-15| and |16-16| should impose |17-18| the ban |19-20| next week |21-23| . |24-24| 
 &quot; |0-0| we do not want to |1-4| find ourselves |5-6| in |7-7| a situation |8-9| where |10-10| a permit |11-12| is |13-13| granted to |14-15| someone |16-17| and |18-18| then |19-19| find ourselves |20-21| facing a |22-24| federal problem |25-26| , &quot; said |27-30| Bob |31-31| Nicholson |32-32| , |33-33| a member |34-35| of the |36-36| municipal council |37-38| . |39-39|

 many |0-1| questions arise |2-4| . |5-5| 
 Petronella |0-0| Wyatt |1-1| : |2-2| I have |3-4| been |5-5| mistreated |6-6| and |7-7| excluded |8-8| from Oxford |9-10| , because |11-12| I was |13-14| a |15-15| &quot; |16-16| Tory |17-17| ( |18-19| Conservative |20-20| ) |21-21| . |22-22| 
 it is not only |0-4| the students of today |5-9| who |10-10| are attacked |11-12| for |13-13| their opinions |14-15| . |16-16| 
 as far |0-1| as I can remember |2-5| , |6-6| I have |7-8| always wanted |9-10| to go |11-12| to |13-13| the University |14-15| of Oxford |16-17| . |18-18| 
 my father |0-1| and |2-2| my |3-3| older brother |4-5| studied |6-7| in what was |8-11| a prominent |14-15| place |16-16| for me |12-13| to know |17-18| , |19-19| a kind |20-21| of |22-22| modern @-@ day |25-27| Greek |24-24| amphitheatre |23-23| which stimulates |28-29| the two |30-31| pillars |32-32| of civilization |33-35| , |36-36| the free |37-38| thought and |39-40| tolerance |41-42| . |43-43| 
 yet , |0-1| two |2-2| weeks |3-3| after |4-5| being |6-6| installed |7-7| at |8-8| Worcester |9-9| College |10-10| in the late |11-14| 1980s |15-16| to study |17-18| history |19-20| , |21-21| I decided to make |22-26| my |27-27| suitcases |28-28| , causing |29-30| the first |31-32| scandal of |33-34| my life |35-36| . |37-37| 
 my father |0-1| collapsed |2-4| and |5-5| began |6-8| to cry |9-10| . |11-11| 
 my friends |0-1| were puzzled |2-3| . |4-4| 
 the |0-0| journal |1-1| of |2-2| The |3-3| Evening Standard |4-5| claimed |6-7| that |8-8| I had |9-10| left |11-11| the university |12-13| , because |14-15| I had |16-17| objected |18-18| to the fact that |19-21| undergraduates |22-26| had |27-27| sex |28-30| in |31-31| the room |32-33| next to |34-36| mine . |37-39| 
 the author |0-1| A. |2-2| N. |3-3| Wilson |4-4| said |5-6| with |7-7| quirk |8-8| that |9-9| I was |10-11| party |12-12| after being |13-15| forced to |16-17| drink |18-18| in |19-19| chipped |22-22| mugs |20-21| . |23-23| 
 the truth |0-1| was less |2-3| funny |4-4| . |5-5| 
 I |0-1| fled |2-2| . |3-3| 
 yes |0-0| , |1-1| I |2-3| fled |4-4| , because |5-6| I had |7-8| been |9-9| the victim of |10-11| intimidation and |12-13| is the subject |14-16| of |17-17| constant |18-18| bullying |19-19| . |20-20| 
 not because |0-3| of |4-4| my name |5-6| rather |7-7| outrageous |8-8| , |9-9| or |10-10| because |11-12| of the fact |13-14| that |15-15| I had |16-17| a |18-19| private school |20-21| . |22-22| 
 I have |0-1| been |2-2| persecuted |3-3| for |4-4| a single |5-8| reason , |9-10| and |11-11| in this |12-13| cradle |14-14| of the so @-@ called |15-18| knowledge , |19-20| I was |21-23| the victim of |24-25| a |26-26| racist |28-28| and barbaric |29-30| behaviour |27-27| : |31-31| my |32-32| late |33-33| father , |34-35| Woodrow |36-36| Wyatt |37-37| , |38-38| was a |39-40| very influential |42-43| advised |41-41| of Margaret |44-45| Thatcher |46-46| and |47-47| I was a |48-49| supporter |50-50| of the |51-51| Conservative Party |52-53| . |54-54| 
 why |0-0| mention |1-1| this |2-2| today |3-4| , |5-5| you might say |6-9| . |10-10| 
 well , |0-2| recent studies |3-5| have shown |6-7| that a |8-9| new generation |10-11| of students |12-13| from the centre @-@ right |14-17| suffers the |18-19| same type |20-21| of persecution |22-23| . |24-24| 
 growing |2-2| hatred |0-1| and |3-3| institutionalized |4-4| Tory |7-7| students |5-6| at Oxford |8-9| is such |10-11| that |12-12| last week |13-15| , |16-16| some of them |17-20| demanded |21-22| protection |23-24| of |25-25| their rights |26-27| , |28-28| as well as |29-32| those |33-33| of gays , |34-37| disabled people |38-39| and ethnic minorities |40-43| . |44-44| 
 Conservative |2-2| members |0-1| of the |3-4| Student |7-7| Room |5-6| ( |8-8| JCR |9-9| ) |10-10| of the Corpus |11-12| Christi |13-13| College |14-14| said they |15-18| were &quot; |19-20| often isolated |21-22| , |23-23| attacked |24-24| personally |25-25| and |26-26| felt |27-28| undesirable &quot; |29-30| because of |31-33| their political views |34-36| . |37-37| 
 they want to |0-1| have |2-5| a representative |6-7| on the Committee |8-11| of |12-12| the university |13-14| for |15-15| equality of opportunity |16-19| so that |20-21| their views |22-23| can be |24-25| expressed |26-26| freely . |27-28| 
 their situation |0-1| has not |2-4| been helped |5-6| by |7-7| the recent |8-9| documentary |10-10| broadcast on |11-12| BBC |13-13| Two |14-14| &quot; |15-15| Wonderland |16-16| : |17-17| Young |18-18| , |19-19| Bright and |20-21| on the Right |22-24| &quot; ( |25-26| &quot; |27-27| The |28-28| Wonderland |29-31| : |32-32| young |33-33| , |34-34| intelligent |35-35| and |36-37| Right |38-38| &quot; ) |39-40| , |41-41| devoted to |42-43| the policy |44-45| among students |46-48| , |49-50| which depicted the |51-53| &quot; Tories |54-55| &quot; |56-56| as |57-58| eccentric |59-59| and |60-60| neo @-@ Nazis |61-62| . |63-63|

 in |0-0| other universities |1-3| , students |4-6| conservatives |7-7| say they are |8-9| treated as |10-12| scapegoats |13-14| for |15-15| the establishment |16-19| of |20-20| the increase |21-22| in tuition fees |23-26| . &quot; |27-28|

 people think |0-3| we are |4-5| like the |6-7| Bullingdon |8-8| Club |9-9| without even |10-11| we |12-12| have |13-13| encountered |14-14| . &quot; |15-16|

 &quot; |0-0| this |1-1| is an |2-3| obstacle to |4-5| the freedom |6-7| of |8-8| intellectual debates |9-10| , |11-11| as well as |12-13| to the well |14-15| @-@ being |16-17| of members |18-19| , &quot; |20-21| she |22-26| said . |27-28| 
 I was |0-1| the only one |2-3| to think |4-5| so |6-8| during |9-11| my first few |12-13| weeks |14-15| at Oxford |16-17| . |18-18| 
 I |0-0| am |1-1| coming |2-2| in September |3-4| 1986 |5-5| , |6-6| I was |7-9| 18 years |12-13| old |10-11| and a |14-16| crippling |18-18| shyness |17-17| . |19-19| 
 hatred |0-1| of the |2-2| Conservative Party |3-4| was very |5-6| virulent |7-7| . |8-8| 
 the previous year |0-2| , |3-3| the university |4-5| had |6-6| voted |7-7| the refusal |8-9| to grant |10-12| Margaret |13-13| Thatcher |14-14| - |15-15| a |16-16| former student |17-18| - |19-19| an |20-20| honorary title |21-22| , |23-23| because of |24-26| the |27-27| reduction in the |28-29| funding of |30-31| higher education . |32-34| 
 the atmosphere |0-1| was |2-2| charged with |3-4| Stalinist |6-6| vibrations |5-5| . |7-7| 
 from the first days |0-3| of |4-4| the week |5-6| , |7-9| when the |10-11| new students |12-13| have been |14-15| acquainted with |16-17| each other |18-19| and |20-20| teachers |21-22| , I had |23-26| a |27-27| foretaste |28-30| of |31-31| what would |32-34| happen |35-36| afterwards |37-39| . |40-40| 
 I discovered |0-2| that teachers |3-5| not only |6-7| participated in the |8-9| taunting |10-10| to |11-11| students |12-13| Tory , |14-15| but |16-19| they |20-21| were |22-23| fun |24-25| . |26-26| 
 it was as if |0-3| the policy |4-5| regarding |6-7| minors |8-9| strikers |10-10| , |11-12| privatization |13-14| and |15-16| the |17-17| government &apos;s |19-20| opposition |18-18| to sanctions |21-22| against apartheid |23-25| in South Africa |26-29| was |30-30| carved into |31-32| the wood |33-34| classrooms |35-38| . |39-39| 
 the first |0-1| sarcasm |2-2| that |3-3| I have |4-5| been the victim |6-7| was |8-8| a translation |9-10| into English |11-13| of the |14-14| 18th century |17-19| French texts |15-16| , |20-20| and |21-21| I wasn &apos;t |22-26| prepared |27-27| . |28-28| 
 &quot; |0-0| Miss |1-1| Wyatt |2-2| , &quot; |3-4| said |5-6| Professor |7-8| Harry |9-9| Pitt |10-10| ( now |11-12| deceased ) |13-14| , |15-15| &quot; |16-16| please |17-17| translate |18-18| the first |19-20| paragraph |21-21| &quot; |22-22| 
 I have |0-1| lost |2-2| . |3-4| 
 Pitt |0-0| , |1-1| a small |2-3| man |4-4| pustular |7-7| facial |5-6| , |8-9| won |10-10| easily . |11-12| 
 &quot; |0-0| is |1-4| the |5-5| Thatcherite |6-6| refuse to |7-8| learn French |9-11| , or |12-12| are they |13-15| just |16-16| stupid |17-17| ? |18-18| &quot; |19-19| he |20-24| asked |25-25| . |26-26| 
 the |0-0| other students |1-2| laughed |3-4| . |5-5| 
 the |4-4| tears |0-2| were burning |3-3| eyes |5-5| . |6-6| 
 &quot; |0-0| I suggest you |1-4| take |5-5| French courses |6-9| during |10-10| your |11-11| free time |12-13| - |14-14| finally , |15-16| if |17-17| you &apos;re not |18-21| too busy |22-23| to |24-24| make friends |25-28| , &quot; |29-30| he |31-35| launched |36-36| a |37-38| fractious |40-40| tone |39-39| . |41-41| 
 I returned |0-2| to my room |3-5| , |6-6| inconsolable |7-7| . |8-8| 
 at the |0-1| dinner |2-2| that evening |3-5| , |6-6| I sat |7-10| alone |11-11| and then |12-12| I felt |13-15| a slight |16-17| tap on |18-19| my shoulder |20-21| . |22-22| 
 it was a |0-2| second @-@ |5-5| year |6-8| student |3-4| of |9-9| English , |10-11| named |12-12| James |13-13| , |14-14| who |15-15| introduced himself |16-18| as a member |19-20| of the |21-22| OUCA |23-23| . |24-24| 
 &quot; |0-0| I know |1-2| who you are |3-5| , &quot; |6-7| he |8-12| said , |13-14| gently |15-15| . |16-16| 
 I am afraid |0-3| that it |4-5| . |6-9| 
 anyone suspected |0-2| of being |3-4| a |5-5| Tory |6-6| ( |7-7| Conservative |8-8| ) |9-9| is |10-10| targeting |11-13| . |14-14| 
 it is hard enough |0-4| for me |5-6| , |7-7| but |8-8| they know |9-10| that |11-11| your father |12-13| is close to |14-16| Margaret |17-17| Thatcher |18-18| , |19-19| it |20-20| will be |21-22| even harder |23-25| for you |26-27| . |28-28| 
 most |0-1| of the young |2-3| Tory |4-4| claim to be |5-7| Labour |8-8| ( |9-9| Labour |10-10| ) |11-11| . |12-12| 
 later |0-1| , |2-2| at the |3-3| local pub |4-5| , |6-6| I |7-8| tried to |10-11| hide |12-13| cowardly |9-9| . |14-14| 
 I insisted |0-2| on |3-3| the fact |4-5| that |6-6| I did |7-9| not agree with |10-13| everything |14-15| that |16-16| Mrs |19-19| Thatcher |20-20| had said |17-18| . |21-21| 
 this |0-0| ploy |1-1| failed |2-3| . |4-4| 
 a |0-0| first @-@ year |3-4| student |1-2| of philosophy |5-6| , |7-7| political and economic |9-11| sciences |8-8| who |12-12| , |13-13| ironically , |14-15| had studied at |16-18| Eton |19-19| , |20-20| said |21-22| : |23-23| &quot; you are |24-26| the daughter |27-28| of a |29-30| fascist |32-32| pig |31-31| . &quot; |33-34| 
 you |0-1| contaminated . |2-3| 
 other |0-1| students have |2-3| taken up |4-4| the refrain |5-6| . |7-7| 
 I was |0-1| perverted |2-2| , |3-3| dirty |4-4| . |5-5| 
 &quot; |0-0| how |1-1| the Tories |2-3| do they |4-6| love |7-8| ? |9-9| &quot; |10-10| asked |11-12| one |13-14| of them |15-17| . |18-18| 
 they |0-1| hit |2-2| each other |3-6| , |7-7| isn &apos;t it |8-12| ? |13-13| &quot; |14-14| 
 I felt |0-3| like |4-4| homosexuals |5-6| before the |7-8| liberal |10-10| legislation |9-9| of the |11-11| 1960s |12-13| . |14-14| 
 would I have |0-2| only |3-3| been able to |4-4| lead a |5-6| normal life |7-8| in Oxford |9-10| ? |11-11| 
 would I have |0-2| been forced |3-4| to meet people |5-8| who share |9-9| the same |10-11| views |12-14| only after |15-16| nightfall |17-21| ? |22-22| 
 should I have |0-3| become |4-4| Labour |5-5| and |6-6| disown |7-7| my opinions |8-9| ? |10-10| 
 the next three years |0-4| would |5-5| resemble a |6-8| purgatory |9-9| of stigma |10-11| and isolation |12-14| . |15-15| 
 the only |0-1| openly |3-3| Tory |4-4| was |5-5| Professor |2-2| Norman |6-6| Stone , |7-8| professor of |9-10| modern history |11-12| , |13-13| who taught |14-15| in |16-16| my university |17-18| . |19-19| 
 he was |0-1| hated |2-2| not only |3-4| because he was |5-8| conservative , but |9-11| also because it |12-15| was |16-16| Thatcher &apos;s |21-22| foreign policy |19-20| adviser |17-18| and |23-23| one |24-25| of the authors |26-27| of |28-28| his speeches |29-30| . |31-31| 
 it |0-0| was |1-2| almost never |3-4| there . |5-6| 
 he |0-0| hated |1-1| this place |2-3| provincial and |4-5| insignificant , |6-7| as well as |8-9| its accession to the |10-12| Marxist |16-16| @-@ deterministic |17-18| view |13-15| of history |19-21| . |22-22| 
 in 1997 |0-1| , |2-2| he accepted |3-4| a |5-5| professorship at |6-9| Bilkent |13-13| University |10-12| in Ankara |14-16| , Turkey |17-19| . |20-20| 
 &quot; |0-0| you will not be |1-4| happy |5-5| here |6-6| , &quot; |7-9| he |10-14| said |15-15| . |16-16| 
 I started |0-3| commuting |4-6| between |7-7| Oxford |8-8| and |9-9| the house |10-11| of |12-12| my parents |13-14| in London |15-16| , finding |17-18| refuge with |19-21| my family |22-23| and |24-25| my friends |26-27| more open |29-30| @-@ minded |31-32| city dwellers |28-28| . |33-33| 
 I told |0-3| my father |4-5| that |6-6| I hated |7-8| Oxford |9-9| and |10-10| I explained |11-14| why |15-15| . |16-16| 
 was |0-1| in disbelief |2-2| . |3-3| 
 during |0-0| his studies |1-2| at Oxford |3-4| , |5-5| in |6-6| the 1940s |7-9| , |10-10| all |11-12| political views |13-16| were |17-17| accepted . |18-19| 
 &quot; |0-0| but |1-1| it is |2-3| the best place |4-6| in the world |7-8| , &quot; |9-11| he |12-16| said |17-17| pathetically |18-18| . |19-19| 
 they |0-0| would not do |1-3| that , not |4-6| in |7-7| the city |8-9| to the |10-10| spires |11-11| dreamers |12-12| . |13-13| 
 even |0-0| my friends |1-2| communists |3-3| had |4-5| impeccable |7-7| manners |6-6| . |8-8| 
 he had |0-1| tears in their |2-4| eyes |5-5| . |6-6| 
 let |0-0| them |1-2| a chance |3-4| . |5-5| 
 I |0-0| am sure |1-2| that |3-3| it is for |4-6| teasing |7-8| . |9-9| 
 I |0-1| would break |2-2| the |3-3| heart |4-4| if you left |5-7| Oxford |8-8| . |9-9| 
 tired |0-0| by |1-1| my |2-2| frequent |3-3| trips |4-4| to London |5-6| , my |7-8| emotional |10-10| strength |9-9| has steadily |11-13| deteriorated |14-14| . |15-15| 
 a friend |0-1| , |2-2| also |3-3| Tory , |4-5| succumbed to |6-8| the pressure |9-10| and |11-11| renounced |12-14| his convictions |15-16| . |17-17| 
 during a |0-3| meeting |4-4| of |5-5| tutorials |6-7| the |8-8| following week |9-10| , |11-11| when |12-12| another |13-14| history professor |15-17| suggested |18-19| the |20-20| more seriously |21-22| in the world |23-24| , |25-25| that |26-26| I was |27-28| &quot; |29-29| an enemy |30-31| of the people |32-33| , &quot; |34-35| I decided |36-38| to do the same |39-42| . |43-43| 
 internally |1-1| blushed |0-0| with shame |2-3| , |4-4| I |5-6| admitted |7-7| to be a victim |8-9| of |10-10| brainwashing |11-13| of |14-14| my parents |15-16| and |17-17| the |18-18| old |22-22| traitai |19-19| &quot; |20-21| crazy |23-23| . &quot; |24-25| 
 the respite |0-1| was short @-@ lived |2-6| . |7-7| 
 it is |0-1| my father |2-3| who |4-4| drove |5-6| the |7-7| last nail |8-9| in my |10-11| coffin |12-12| oxfordien |13-13| . |14-14| 
 at that time |0-2| , |3-3| he wrote |4-5| two |6-6| columns |7-7| in |8-8| the |9-9| Murdoch |12-12| press |10-11| each |13-13| week . |14-15| 
 my door |0-1| was |2-2| locked . |3-4| 
 I stayed |0-2| cowering |3-3| in |4-4| my room |5-6| , |7-7| and after |8-9| five minutes |10-11| , |12-12| my |13-13| pursuers |14-14| have abandoned |15-16| . |17-17| 
 when |0-0| they left |1-3| , |4-4| I packed my bag |5-9| and |10-10| I took |11-13| the first |14-15| train to |16-17| London . |18-19| 
 I |0-0| never went back |1-5| . |6-6| 
 you can |0-1| treat |3-4| me |2-2| wimp |5-6| pleurnicharde |7-7| . |8-8| 
 but |0-0| no children under |1-3| 18 |4-5| should not |6-7| be a victim |8-9| of such a |10-12| bullying |13-13| in |14-14| school . |15-18| 
 the tragedy |0-2| is |3-3| that it was |4-8| Oxford , |9-10| who |11-11| not only |12-13| produced |14-15| 14 |16-16| Tory |19-19| prime ministers |17-18| , |20-20| but |21-21| also enjoys |22-24| a |25-25| strong |26-26| reputation |27-27| of equality and freedom |28-32| of thought |33-34| . |35-35|

 it |0-0| may seem |1-2| unlikely |3-3| that |4-4| these words |5-6| come from |7-8| an advertisement for |9-11| mint |14-16| lozenges |12-13| , |17-17| but |18-18| despite this |19-20| , |21-21| or |22-22| perhaps because of |23-27| this , |28-29| the video |30-31| has spread |32-34| like wildfire |35-39| on YouTube |40-41| in Singapore |42-43| earlier this year |44-48| . |49-49| 
 the lyrics |0-1| from |2-3| a |4-4| rap group |5-7| that uses |8-10| local references |11-12| such as |13-13| &quot; |14-14| Let &apos;s |15-15| put a |16-17| handset |18-18| in |19-19| the drawer |20-21| &quot; to |22-23| mock |24-25| the |26-26| birth rate |27-29| in Singapore |30-31| . |32-32| 
 BBH |0-0| , |1-1| the advertising agency |2-5| behind |6-9| the video |10-11| , |12-12| hopes to |13-13| draw attention to |14-17| the problem |18-19| of |20-20| fun way |21-22| through |23-24| this advertising |25-26| . |27-27| 
 its |0-0| creative director |1-2| , |3-3| Douglas |4-4| Hamilton |5-5| , |6-6| said |7-8| that he |9-10| wanted to |11-11| use the |12-13| power of music |14-17| for people to |18-21| perform |22-22| &quot; |23-23| their |24-24| national duty |25-26| . &quot; |27-28| 
 it is intended |0-2| solely |3-3| to |4-4| the Internet |5-6| , |7-7| so we were able to |8-11| make it |12-13| entertaining |14-14| and fun |15-16| . |17-17| 
 this is the |0-3| main problem |4-5| in this |6-7| country . |8-9| 
 we are |0-1| the worst |2-3| in the world |4-5| in the area |6-8| of |9-9| the birth rate |10-11| , and |12-13| we felt that |14-16| it was |17-18| a theme |19-20| that we have to |21-23| address |24-24| . |25-25| 
 we knew |0-1| that the |2-3| government had |4-5| tried |6-6| several |7-7| things like |8-9| launching |10-11| pheromone |13-14| scents |12-12| or |15-15| organize |16-17| speed @-@ dating |20-22| evenings |18-19| . |23-23| 
 many of these |0-2| ideas |3-3| were |4-4| creative |5-5| , but |6-6| they |7-7| have not necessarily |8-11| worked . |12-13| 
 we |0-2| therefore |3-3| said |4-4| the |5-5| following : |6-8| what could be more |9-11| creative |12-12| in solving |13-14| this problem |15-16| than to |17-19| make a |20-21| rap |24-24| song |22-23| ? |25-25| 
 1.2 @-@ |0-0| children |1-1| 
 the Government |0-1| of Singapore |2-3| does |4-5| not |7-8| take |6-6| lightly |9-11| . |12-12| 
 he |0-0| spends |1-1| US $ |3-4| 1,300 |2-2| per year |5-6| in |7-7| policies to |8-9| encourage |10-10| its citizens |11-12| to |13-13| have more children |14-17| . |18-18| 
 a measure |0-1| of the government |2-3| in favour |4-5| of |6-6| marriage and |7-8| fathers |9-10| grants |11-11| of up to |12-13| $ |15-15| 15,000 |14-14| per child |16-17| , |18-18| extended |19-19| maternity leave |20-23| and |24-24| distributes |25-26| tax |28-28| benefits |27-27| . |29-29| 
 but |0-0| all this |1-2| has had little effect |3-7| . |8-8| 
 Singapore |0-0| is a |1-2| wealthy |6-6| city @-@ state |3-5| high @-@ tech |8-10| and |7-7| South |11-12| @-@ East |13-14| Asia , |15-18| also |19-19| known for |20-21| the conservatism |22-23| of |24-24| its leaders |25-26| and its |27-28| strict |29-29| social |31-31| controls |30-30| . |32-32| 
 the birth rate |0-3| in Singapore |4-5| , |6-6| in accordance with |7-8| its |9-9| national distribution |10-11| of |12-12| population , |13-14| currently stands at |15-18| 1.2 |19-19| children |20-20| per woman |21-22| . |23-23| 
 the |0-0| last time he |1-4| has been |5-7| above |8-11| 2 |12-12| , |13-13| regarded as |14-15| the rate |16-17| of |18-18| renewal |19-19| , |20-20| it was |21-22| in 1976 |23-24| . |25-25| 
 why |0-1| Singaporeans |2-3| don &apos;t they have |4-8| more children |9-11| ? |12-12| 
 Tan |0-0| Wei |1-1| Ming , |2-3| policy |5-6| director |4-4| of marriage |7-8| and |9-10| the family |11-12| of the |13-14| National |16-16| Population |17-19| Division |15-15| , says |20-21| that |22-22| this is |23-24| due to |25-26| a |27-27| &quot; |28-28| better education |29-30| &quot; |31-31| and |32-33| &quot; |34-34| a wider choice |35-38| of |39-39| career opportunities |40-42| . &quot; |43-44| 
 &quot; |0-0| this has |1-2| enabled |3-4| people |5-5| to have a |6-9| wider range |10-12| of options |13-14| in terms |15-16| of |17-17| life goals |18-20| and |21-22| priorities , |23-24| beyond the |25-28| marriage |29-29| and |30-31| family formation |32-36| , &quot; |37-38| she says |39-43| . |44-44| 
 these |0-0| changes in |1-2| social norms |3-4| have |5-5| contributed to |6-7| the increase |8-9| in the number |10-11| of |12-12| single and |13-14| to delay |15-16| marriage |17-18| and |19-19| childbearing |20-21| , |22-22| resulting in |23-27| a |28-28| decline in the |29-30| birth rate |31-33| in Singapore |34-35| . |36-36| 
 meanwhile |0-2| , |3-3| an immigration policy |4-7| aimed at |8-9| radically |11-11| increase |10-10| immigration |12-13| to counter |14-15| the decline |16-17| of |18-18| the population |19-20| has created |21-22| resentment |23-24| among the |25-28| local population |29-30| . |31-31| 
 in Singapore |0-1| , |2-2| there are |3-4| websites that |5-8| abounds |9-9| a |10-10| barely |12-13| disguised |14-14| xenophobia |11-11| against |15-18| new immigrants |19-20| , |21-21| especially |22-23| to the |24-25| Chinese |26-26| who |27-27| are accused |28-29| of |30-30| shooting |31-31| down wages |32-36| and |37-37| not to |38-40| integrate |41-42| . |43-43| 
 the increase in |0-2| immigration |3-4| is also |5-6| seen as |7-8| one of the |9-10| reasons why |11-13| the party |14-15| in place |16-17| in Singapore |18-19| last year |22-24| suffered |20-21| its worst |25-26| election result |27-28| since independence |29-31| . |32-32| 
 since |0-0| the elections |1-2| , |3-3| they tried |4-6| to correct |7-8| the problem |9-10| with |11-11| the establishment |12-15| of quotas |16-17| and |18-19| higher taxes |20-22| for |23-23| foreign workers |24-26| . |27-27| 
 unexpected |1-1| consequences |0-0| 
 while |0-1| the fall in the |2-4| birth rate |5-7| has |8-9| known effects |10-11| on |12-12| a country &apos;s economic |15-18| growth |13-14| , |19-19| tax revenues |20-22| , |23-23| health costs |24-26| and |27-27| immigration policies |28-31| , |32-32| the example |33-34| of |35-35| Singapore also |36-38| unintended consequences |39-41| . |42-42| 
 the government |0-1| is trying to |2-3| prevent |4-4| the construction |5-6| of |7-7| many small |8-9| houses . |10-11| 
 for example |0-1| , |2-2| it started |3-5| to |6-6| affect |7-7| the |8-8| real estate sector |9-10| . |11-11| 
 the authorities |0-1| of urban development |2-4| began |5-6| to control |7-8| the number |9-10| of small |11-12| apartments |13-13| , |14-14| known as the |15-19| &quot; |20-20| shoe box |21-23| , &quot; |24-25| which can be |26-27| built |28-28| in specific areas |29-32| of |33-33| the city |34-35| . |36-36| 
 these |0-0| apartments |1-1| have |2-2| an area of |3-5| 46 |6-6| square metres |7-8| and |9-9| their |10-10| sale |11-11| has been a great |12-14| success . |15-16| 
 however , |0-1| the authorities |2-3| are |4-4| concerned about |5-6| the fact |7-8| that they can |9-11| promote |12-12| a lifestyle |13-16| of |17-17| single and |18-19| discourage |20-20| developers |21-22| wanting to |23-23| build |24-24| large |25-26| family homes |27-28| . |29-29| 
 but |0-0| Lim |1-1| Yew |2-2| Soon |3-3| , Director |4-5| @-@ General |6-6| of the |7-8| property company |9-10| EL |11-11| Developers |12-12| , says |13-14| that its |15-16| &quot; |17-17| shoe boxes |18-20| &quot; |21-21| sell |22-23| much faster than |24-27| the |28-28| larger |30-31| housing |29-29| . |32-32| 
 they |0-0| are more popular |1-3| , |4-4| in the |5-6| sense that |7-8| these |9-9| houses |10-10| are built |11-12| far more |13-14| quickly than |15-16| larger |18-21| ones |17-17| . |22-22| 
 for |0-0| this reason |1-2| , |3-3| it is |4-5| much more |6-7| cost @-@ effective |8-8| for our |9-10| cash |11-11| . |12-12| 
 however , |0-1| he admits |2-3| that the |4-5| new standards |6-7| provide |8-9| clearer |11-12| instructions |10-10| to developers |13-14| , |15-15| who |16-17| previously |20-20| were put |18-19| a spanner in the works |21-25| if they |26-27| wished to |28-28| propose |29-29| too |30-30| small |31-32| in |34-34| a |35-35| housing |33-33| project . |36-37| 
 too much stress |0-2| 
 Singapore |0-0| is a |1-2| city @-@ state |3-5| . |6-6| 
 if |0-3| these |4-4| new regulations |5-6| could be |7-8| a |9-9| step towards |10-11| increasing the |12-14| national |18-18| birth rate |15-17| , |19-19| by talking with |20-22| Singaporeans |23-24| who work |25-26| in the |27-28| financial district |29-30| of central |31-32| , |33-33| it would appear |34-35| that they do not |36-40| have much effect |41-44| . |45-45| 
 &quot; people |0-2| are |3-3| very stressed |4-5| , |6-6| the houses |7-8| are |9-9| expensive |10-10| , |11-11| like |12-13| education |14-15| , |16-16| that is why |17-21| people |22-23| give to |24-26| later |27-28| , &quot; |29-30| said |31-31| a young |32-33| framework . |34-35| 
 other |0-1| people may |2-3| have children |4-6| . |7-7| 
 &quot; |0-0| but |1-1| for me |2-3| , |4-4| it is |5-6| important to be able to |7-9| have |10-11| my money |12-13| and |14-15| my time |16-17| , &quot; |18-19| says |20-21| another |22-23| young |24-24| 20 years |25-29| . |30-30| 
 men |0-1| and |2-2| women report |3-5| their careers |6-7| , stress |8-10| and |11-11| the cost |12-13| of |14-14| home ownership |15-19| and |20-21| education |22-23| as |24-24| the reasons |25-26| preventing them |27-28| from having children |29-32| . |33-33| 
 thus , |0-1| although |2-3| the government |4-5| is trying to |6-7| convince |8-8| its citizens |9-10| to have children |11-14| , |15-15| when it comes |16-19| to |20-21| babies |22-23| , |24-26| Singaporeans |27-28| themselves |29-31| who have |32-33| the |34-34| last word |35-36| . |37-37|

 the |0-0| boy |1-2| recognizes |3-3| that it was wrong to |4-8| publish |9-10| obscene |12-12| photos |11-11| of |13-14| naked people |15-16| , crimes |17-19| or |20-21| write |22-23| humiliating comments |24-25| or |26-26| violent . |27-28| 
 Jorge |0-0| ensures |1-1| that he |2-3| knows his |4-5| 35 |6-6| friends |7-7| on |8-8| FB |9-9| as well as |10-11| its nine |12-13| subscribers |14-14| on Twitter |15-16| . |17-17|

 he said |0-1| that he |2-3| would never accept |4-6| the request |7-8| of an |9-10| unknown person |11-12| . |13-13| 
 he |0-0| will |1-2| also not |3-5| trust |6-7| someone |8-9| who |10-11| would recommend |12-12| a foreigner |13-14| . |15-15| 
 the case |0-1| of |2-2| José |3-3| , 14 |4-5| years old |6-6| , |7-7| is different |8-9| . |10-10| 
 the |0-0| teenager |1-1| has |2-2| account |3-4| on |5-5| Hotmail |6-6| , |7-7| Facebook , |8-9| MySpace |10-11| and Ask |12-13| , |14-14| on |15-15| the latter |16-17| , |18-18| he |19-19| admitted that he did not |20-22| know |23-23| 20 |24-24| people on |25-28| its list |29-30| of friends |31-32| . |33-33| 
 &quot; it |0-1| does not worry me |2-5| because |6-7| we have |8-9| something |10-11| in common |12-13| , music |14-16| , for example |17-18| , &quot; |19-20| he says |21-25| . |26-26| 
 according to the |0-1| boy |2-3| , |4-4| nobody |5-6| has |7-8| made |9-9| advances |10-11| nor |12-13| asked him |14-16| his |17-17| address or |18-19| phone number |20-23| . |24-24| 
 &quot; |0-0| if they |1-2| gave me |3-4| the pressure |5-6| or |7-8| required |9-9| , |10-10| I |11-12| simply |14-14| supprimerais |13-13| from my |15-16| account |17-17| , &quot; |18-19| he says . |20-23| 
 José |0-0| has subscribed to |1-4| Ask |5-5| after reading |6-8| a recommendation |9-10| on Twitter |11-12| . |13-13| 
 the experiences |0-1| that |2-2| we know today |3-6| under the name |7-9| of |10-10| cyberstalking |11-11| are not |12-14| foreign to the |15-16| boy |17-18| . |19-19| 
 a relative |0-1| of |2-2| one of my friends |3-6| was |7-8| extorted money |9-9| on |10-10| a |11-11| social network |12-13| . |14-14| 
 they threatened him |0-3| and |4-4| demanded |5-6| money |7-9| . |10-10| 
 &quot; |0-0| he never |1-4| knew |5-5| who |6-6| it was |7-8| , &quot; |9-9| he says |10-14| . |15-15| 
 the victim |0-1| , |2-2| according to |3-3| José |4-4| , |5-5| has not |6-8| closed |9-9| his account |10-11| . |12-12| 
 &quot; |0-0| he |1-2| has |3-3| only |4-4| happened |5-5| in |6-6| private |8-8| profile |7-7| . &quot; |9-10| 
 he |0-0| then |3-3| tells us |1-2| a series |4-5| of manipulation |6-7| to configure |8-9| his account |10-11| safely |12-14| . |15-15| 
 unlike |0-3| Jorge |4-4| , |5-5| this young |6-7| posterait |8-8| photos of |9-11| knowledge in |12-14| uncomfortable |16-16| or |17-17| embarrassing |18-18| situations |15-15| . |19-19| 
 yes |0-0| , I would do it |1-4| if |5-5| I was |6-7| angry |8-8| or |9-9| upset |10-10| . |11-11| 
 &quot; |0-0| even though |1-2| I know |3-4| that |5-5| it is |6-7| the |8-8| cyberstalking |9-9| , &quot; |10-11| he says |12-16| . |17-17| 
 key issues |0-1| 
 Marielos |0-0| Porras |1-1| , a professor |2-3| of |4-4| English |5-5| and a degree in |6-8| Education and |9-10| Learning , |11-12| considers that |13-14| , |15-15| to guide |16-17| children |18-19| and |20-20| adolescents |21-22| , we |23-24| must |25-25| understand |26-26| that |27-27| the goal |28-29| of |30-30| social networks |31-32| is |33-33| to inform |34-35| . |36-36| 
 &quot; |0-0| the Internet |1-2| has |3-3| emerged |4-4| as |5-5| a means |6-7| to seek |8-9| information |10-11| but |12-12| , |13-13| with |14-14| the emergence |15-16| of |17-17| these sites |18-19| , |20-20| the rules of the game |21-24| have changed |25-26| , &quot; |27-28| she says |29-33| . |34-34| 
 Porras |0-0| said |1-1| that the |2-3| academician |4-4| Marc |5-5| Prensky |6-6| , |7-7| who |8-8| has a |9-10| master &apos;s degree |11-11| in education from |12-14| Yale University |15-18| and |19-19| author |20-20| of the book |21-22| &quot; |23-23| Digital |27-27| Natives |24-24| and |25-25| immigrants |26-26| , &quot; |28-29| uses these |30-31| words |32-32| to explain |33-34| the phenomenon |35-36| . |37-37| 
 the digital natives |0-2| , |3-3| they , |4-7| children |8-9| and |10-10| young people |11-12| who |13-13| are |14-14| born with |15-16| the technology |17-18| . |19-19| 
 &quot; we |0-1| , |2-2| we are |3-4| digital |7-7| immigrants |5-6| who |8-8| must |9-9| then |10-10| teach them |11-12| , |13-13| while |14-15| we are |16-20| in the process of learning |21-24| , &quot; |25-26| she says |27-29| . |30-30| 
 he |0-0| adds |1-1| that |2-2| the issue |3-4| is complex |5-6| , |7-7| &quot; |8-8| because |9-10| we ask them |11-13| to have |14-15| a |16-16| defined |18-18| criteria |17-17| on |19-19| what should |20-23| or not |24-25| to disclose |26-27| , publish or |28-32| say |33-33| at an age when |34-37| they |38-38| do not have |39-41| the maturity to |42-45| do so |46-47| . &quot; |48-49| 
 &quot; we |0-1| are also asking them to |2-5| be selective |6-7| when |8-9| what |10-11| matters most to them |12-15| is |16-16| to be popular |17-19| , |20-20| to have |21-22| thousands |23-24| of friends |25-26| without thinking of the |27-29| consequences , &quot; |30-31| she says |32-36| . |37-37| 
 according to |0-0| the |1-1| specialist |2-2| , |3-3| the |4-4| most effective way |5-8| to teach |9-10| confidentiality |11-12| to children |13-14| and adolescents |15-17| is |18-18| to use |19-20| issues that |21-23| make them |24-25| think . |26-27| 
 &quot; |0-0| tell them |1-2| not to |3-5| do so |6-7| is no good |8-11| , &quot; |12-13| she says |14-18| . |19-19| 
 then |0-0| , |1-1| Porras |2-2| lists |3-3| some examples |4-5| : |6-6| there are things |7-11| that |12-12| you |13-13| would not be telling |14-16| a stranger |17-19| , |20-20| why |21-22| are you doing |23-25| on |26-26| the Internet |27-28| ? |29-29| 
 or |0-0| , you |1-3| like to |4-6| publish |7-9| a photo |10-11| of you |12-13| as |14-16| a friend |17-18| that |19-19| you |20-21| published |22-22| ? |23-23| 
 do you know |0-2| what others |3-6| publish |7-7| on you |8-9| ? |10-10| 
 when you |0-1| see |2-3| pictures of |4-5| holidays , |6-7| requests |8-8| you |9-10| to other |11-12| people |13-13| permission to |14-16| identify them |17-18| ? |19-19| 
 and |0-0| also |1-1| , |2-2| everyone |3-5| he |6-10| need |11-11| to know |12-13| what you &apos;re doing |14-17| at any moment |18-20| ? |21-21| 
 another point |0-2| is to |3-4| make them understand |5-7| that they |8-9| must act |10-11| in |12-12| line |13-13| as they do |14-17| offline |18-19| . |20-20| 
 these are the |0-2| same rules |3-4| . |5-5| 
 &quot; |0-0| out of |1-2| the Internet |3-4| , |5-5| everyone must |6-7| act with |8-9| respect |10-10| , |11-11| morality and |12-13| other |14-15| principles , |16-17| this must |18-19| be the same |20-21| on |22-22| social networks |23-25| , &quot; |26-27| she says |28-32| . |33-33| 
 surveillance , |0-0| 
 Estuardo |0-0| Guardia |1-1| , |2-2| university professor |3-5| , |6-6| primary |8-8| school teacher |7-7| and |9-9| educational |11-12| consultant |10-10| , said |13-14| that it |15-16| is essential |17-18| that parents |19-21| read |22-22| carefully |23-23| the conditions |24-25| of use |26-27| of |28-28| social networks |29-30| . |31-31| 
 by understanding |0-1| each of the |2-3| terms |4-4| , |5-5| they will have |6-7| a solid foundation |8-10| to discuss |11-12| with |13-13| their children |14-15| about the implications of |16-18| the opening |19-20| of |21-21| an account |22-23| on the Internet |24-25| . |26-26| 
 &quot; |0-0| for example |1-2| , age |3-5| and |6-6| what |7-8| it is |9-10| allowed |11-11| to share |12-13| or |14-14| to publish |15-16| , &quot; he said |17-21| . |22-22| 
 according to |0-0| Guardia |1-1| , |2-2| it is |3-4| essential to |5-6| remind |7-8| children |9-9| that we should not |10-14| talk |15-15| to foreigners |16-17| . |18-18| 
 the summit |0-1| of the |2-3| Unasur |4-4| ended |5-7| without |8-9| the Lima Declaration |10-13| is made public |14-16| 
 the |0-0| sixth |1-1| presidential |3-3| summit |2-2| of |4-4| the Union |5-6| of South American Nations |7-11| ( |12-12| Unasur ) |13-14| ended |15-17| today |18-19| in Peru |20-21| without |22-23| the Lima Declaration |24-27| was |28-29| made public |30-31| , |32-32| although it has |33-36| been |37-37| previously announced |38-39| and |40-40| theoretically |41-41| adopted by |42-43| the |44-44| 7 |45-45| agents |46-46| present . |47-48| 
 EFE |0-0| has tried |1-2| several times |3-5| to access the |6-8| document signed |9-10| at the |11-13| 6th |14-14| Ordinary |16-16| Meeting |15-15| of Heads of |17-19| State |20-20| and Government of the |21-25| Unasur |26-26| , |27-27| but |28-28| the Department |29-30| of Foreign Affairs |31-33| and |34-34| the Presidency |35-36| reported |37-38| initially |39-40| that he |41-42| would be |43-43| released |44-44| after |45-45| the close |46-47| of the summit |48-49| , and |50-51| said |52-53| that he |54-55| would be |56-56| released |57-57| from |58-58| time to time |59-63| on the website of the |64-68| Peruvian government |69-70| . |71-71| 
 when asked |0-4| about |5-5| the text |6-7| , they |8-9| reported |10-11| that |12-12| its contents |13-14| had |15-15| been exposed |16-17| by |18-18| the president |19-20| of Peru |21-22| , |23-23| Ollante |24-24| Humala , |25-26| in |27-28| brief |29-29| statements to |30-31| the press |32-33| . |34-34| 
 journalists &apos; |2-3| access |0-1| to information about |4-6| the summit |7-8| was |9-10| constantly |11-11| limited . |12-13| 
 during |0-0| the day |1-2| , only |3-4| the video |5-6| without |7-7| the sound |8-9| of the |10-11| presidential |13-13| meeting |12-12| with |14-14| the message |15-16| &quot; |17-17| closed session |18-19| , |20-20| small |22-22| audio |21-21| was |23-24| broadcast |25-25| in |26-26| the press room |27-30| . |31-31| 
 the |0-0| little information |1-3| circulating |4-5| among |6-6| journalists |7-8| were |9-10| those given |11-12| by the press attachés |13-17| of some |18-19| of the governments |20-21| of the |22-23| Unasur |24-24| who |25-25| attended the |26-27| meeting |28-30| , |31-31| with the exception of the |32-35| Peruvian |39-39| spokesman |36-38| . |40-40| 
 the only |0-1| document |2-2| disclosed |3-3| during |4-5| the day |6-7| was |8-9| the list of |10-12| presidents |13-13| present |14-14| , |15-15| which |16-17| has caused |18-19| unease among |20-23| the hundreds |24-25| of journalists |26-27| from various |28-29| national and international media |30-33| calling for |34-35| more |38-39| information |36-37| . |40-40| 
 later |0-1| , |2-2| the presidency |3-4| of Peru |5-6| sent an |7-9| email |10-11| to the media |12-13| with |14-14| the |15-15| &quot; |16-16| final declaration |17-18| &quot; |19-19| of the summit |20-21| , |22-22| but |23-23| it was the |24-27| speech |28-28| of President |29-30| Humala |31-31| and |32-32| not the |33-34| official document |35-36| that |37-37| concluded |38-39| the summit |40-41| . |42-42| 
 last October |0-2| , |3-3| Peru |4-5| hosted the |6-10| 3rd |11-11| summit of South American and |12-16| Arab |18-18| Countries |17-17| ( |19-19| ASPA |20-20| ) |21-21| and |22-22| , |23-23| on this occasion |24-26| , |27-27| although this has |28-31| been |32-32| urged |33-35| by |36-36| the press |37-38| , |39-39| he had not |40-43| released |44-44| the |45-47| statement |48-48| also called the |49-50| Declaration of |51-52| Lima |53-53| , |54-54| as had |55-57| been |58-58| previously |59-59| announced |60-60| . |61-61| 
 on the |0-1| official website |2-3| of the |4-5| ASPA |6-6| , |7-7| we can |8-9| verify |10-10| that |11-11| the document |12-13| was published |14-16| last March |17-21| . |22-22| 
 in |0-0| the two |1-2| international events |3-6| , |7-7| the Peruvian authorities |8-10| have |11-11| tried to |12-13| put in place |14-17| safe |21-21| transmission systems |18-20| for |22-22| all |23-24| journalists , |25-26| but |27-27| they |28-28| have limited |29-30| maximum |31-32| obtaining |33-35| information . |36-37|

 President |0-1| Correa |2-2| , |3-3| who |4-4| participated |5-6| in the sixth |7-8| summit of |9-10| the Union of |11-13| South American |15-17| Nations |14-14| ( |18-18| Unasur ) |19-20| , |21-21| located |22-22| in Lima |23-24| , |25-25| said |26-27| on state television |28-32| , |33-33| TV |34-34| Peru |35-35| , |36-36| that Europeans |37-39| &quot; |40-40| were |41-42| killing each other |43-43| during |44-45| the |46-46| Second World War |47-49| &quot; and |50-51| in |52-52| other conflicts |53-55| , |56-56| &quot; |57-57| but |58-58| that they |59-60| were |61-61| now |62-62| almost |63-63| a homeland |64-65| . &quot; |66-67| 
 in |0-0| this sense |1-2| , |3-3| he defended |4-6| the project |7-8| to establish |9-10| a |11-11| South American |13-15| citizenship |12-12| encouraged by |16-17| the member countries |18-20| of the |21-22| Unasur |23-23| . |24-24|

 those who |0-1| have bombarded us |2-5| is |6-7| never |9-10| compromise |8-8| , |11-11| on the other hand , |12-15| we , the |16-18| South American |19-21| , |22-22| have |23-24| all signed |25-26| . |27-27| 
 &quot; |0-0| it is |1-2| incomprehensible |3-3| that the |4-5| Inter @-@ American |7-7| Commission |6-6| on Human Rights |8-12| is in Washington |13-16| in |17-17| the financing |18-19| of the |20-20| United States |21-23| , &quot; |24-25| he |26-30| said |31-31| , |32-32| alluding to |33-36| granted |40-40| political asylum |37-39| by |41-41| Ecuador |42-43| to the |44-44| founder of |45-46| WikiLeaks , |47-48| Julian |49-49| Assange |50-50| . |51-51| 
 Correa |0-0| said that he |1-3| does not regret |4-6| his decision |7-8| , because |9-10| he did |11-13| not |17-17| himself |14-16| betrayed |18-18| its principles |19-20| , |21-21| but |22-22| he |23-24| instead |25-26| met its |27-28| &quot; |29-29| profound |30-30| democratic values |31-32| and |33-34| human |36-38| rights |35-35| . &quot; |39-40| 
 he |0-0| concluded |1-2| that , at |3-4| the time , |5-7| &quot; |8-8| there was |9-12| suspicion that |13-16| Assange |17-17| would be |18-18| extradited to |19-20| a third country |21-23| , and that |24-25| his trial |26-27| would not be |28-30| respected |31-31| . &quot; |32-33| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| he criticizes |3-4| Swedish |7-7| justice |5-6| who |8-8| demanded |9-10| that he abide |11-14| on |15-15| its territory |16-17| for questioning on |18-21| an |22-22| alleged sexual |24-25| offence |23-23| while |26-27| &quot; |28-28| the |29-29| Swedish |32-32| legislation |30-31| makes it possible to |33-34| do so |35-36| by |37-37| video conference |38-38| , which could |39-42| be |43-44| from |45-45| the Embassy |46-47| of |48-48| Ecuador |49-50| in London |51-52| . &quot; |53-54| 
 Correa |0-0| said |1-2| that there was |3-5| a risk |6-7| that |8-8| the mental and physical health |9-13| of |14-14| Assange |15-15| deteriorates |16-17| . |18-18| 
 &quot; I |0-1| have not spoken to him |2-6| since he |7-9| is in |10-12| our embassy |13-14| , |15-15| but |16-16| the ambassador |17-18| informed me |19-21| that he had |22-24| a small |25-26| problem |27-27| , |28-29| but |30-30| nothing |31-32| serious |33-33| , &quot; |34-35| said |36-37| the president |38-39| of Ecuador |40-40| . |41-41| 
 it is |0-1| possible |2-2| that his |3-4| physical and mental health |5-8| is deteriorating |9-10| by |11-11| the fact |12-13| of being |14-15| locked in |16-17| a small |18-19| space |20-20| without being able to |21-23| exercise |24-25| in the open air . |26-30| 
 &quot; it |0-1| affects |2-3| the health |4-5| of |6-6| anyone |7-9| , &quot; |10-11| he concludes . |12-15| 
 Correa |0-0| said |1-1| that |2-2| the solution |3-4| granted |7-7| asylum |5-6| to |8-8| Assange |9-9| since June |10-14| in |15-15| the |16-16| Ecuadorian |18-18| embassy |17-17| in London |19-20| , which |21-22| would be |23-23| a |24-27| safe conduct |28-30| that |31-31| would allow him |32-33| to travel to |34-37| Ecuador , |38-39| lies in the hands |40-44| of the |45-46| Great |47-47| Britain |48-49| , Sweden |50-53| and the |54-55| European judicial authorities |56-58| , and |59-59| he stressed |60-61| that he |62-63| had discussions |64-67| in London |68-69| to |70-71| find a |72-73| solution to |74-75| the detention |76-77| of the founder |78-79| of |80-80| WikiLeaks . |81-82| 
 we do not negotiate with |0-4| human rights |5-9| , |10-10| we do not use |11-14| this |15-15| word in |16-17| this case |18-19| , |20-20| but |21-21| there have been |22-25| ongoing discussions |26-28| . |29-29| 
 &quot; |0-0| the solution |1-2| to |3-3| this problem |4-5| lies |6-7| in |8-8| the hands |9-10| of |11-11| Great |12-13| Britain |14-15| , Sweden |16-19| and the |20-21| European judicial authorities |22-24| as |25-25| the lawyer |26-27| for |28-28| Assange |29-29| , |30-30| Baltazar |31-31| Garzón |32-32| , |33-33| launched |34-35| a series |36-38| of procedures |39-40| to |41-42| various European bodies |43-45| , &quot; |46-47| he |48-52| said |53-53| . |54-54| 
 and |0-0| he believes that |1-3| &quot; if |4-5| Britain |6-9| gave |10-10| the |11-11| safe conduct |12-14| tomorrow |15-16| , it would end |17-20| . &quot; |21-22| 
 and |0-0| if |1-1| Sweden |2-3| , as |4-6| is |7-7| entirely |8-10| its legislation |11-12| , |13-13| and |14-14| as |15-15| it has done |16-20| in other cases |21-24| , |25-25| asked |26-26| Mr Assange |27-28| in |29-29| the |30-30| Ecuadorian |33-33| embassy |31-32| in London |34-35| , |36-36| or |37-37| asked |38-39| via |40-40| Skype |41-41| tomorrow , |42-43| the problem |44-45| would be |46-47| solved |48-48| . |49-49| 
 Correa |0-0| took the opportunity to |1-4| reaffirm itself |5-6| as a defender |7-10| of |11-11| freedom |12-13| of |14-14| the press |15-16| , and |17-17| he said |18-20| that what he |21-24| did not tolerate |25-27| was &quot; |28-29| mediocrity |30-31| , |32-32| bad faith |33-35| and |36-36| the lies |37-38| that interfere with |39-41| the freedom |42-43| of expression |44-45| . &quot; |46-47| 
 &quot; |0-0| the greatest |1-3| enemies of |4-5| freedom |6-7| of |8-8| the press |9-10| are not |11-13| malicious |17-17| or perverse |18-19| politicians |14-16| but |20-20| bad |21-22| journalists |23-23| in the pay of |24-27| greed |28-29| , |30-30| blackmail |31-32| and |33-34| extortion |35-36| , &quot; |37-38| he |39-43| said . |44-45| 
 in this light |0-2| , it |3-4| welcomed |5-7| that this |8-9| is not |10-12| that kind |13-14| of journalists |15-16| &quot; neither |17-18| bankers |19-20| nor the |21-22| hegemonic |24-24| countries |23-23| and |25-25| bourgeois |26-26| who |27-27| dominate |28-28| Ecuador |29-30| &quot; and |31-32| , |33-33| rather than |34-35| to highlight |36-39| his re @-@ election |40-41| , |42-42| &quot; |43-43| he |44-44| would expand |45-45| the revolution |46-47| to |48-48| continue the |49-50| path |51-51| and |52-52| chart the |53-54| right path |55-56| . &quot; |57-58| 
 Correa |0-0| also supported |1-3| the decision to |4-6| maintain the ban on |7-10| Paraguay |11-12| within |13-15| the |16-16| Unasur |17-17| at least |18-19| until the next elections |20-23| , |24-25| arguing |26-26| that |27-27| the agency |28-29| &quot; should |30-31| be firm |32-34| and not |35-37| tolerate |38-38| opportunism |39-40| and |41-42| disguised |48-48| coup attempts |43-47| , &quot; |49-50| because |51-51| in reality |52-53| , |54-54| &quot; it |55-56| destroyed |57-57| the legitimacy |58-59| of the |60-61| Paraguayan |63-63| democracy |62-62| . &quot; |64-65| 
 what is more |0-2| , |3-3| the president |4-5| of Ecuador |6-6| considers to be |7-8| &quot; |9-9| perfectly |10-10| appropriate |11-11| &quot; |12-12| the desire |13-14| of his |15-16| Colombian |18-18| counterpart |17-17| , |19-19| Juan Manuel |20-21| Santos |22-22| , |23-24| negotiate with |25-26| Nicaragua |27-28| maritime |31-31| boundaries |29-30| between the |32-33| two countries |34-35| through the |36-39| judgment |40-40| of the |41-42| International Court |43-44| in |45-45| The Hague |46-47| , |48-48| which |49-50| will strengthen |51-51| Nicaragua &apos;s |55-56| maritime sovereignty |52-54| . |57-57| 
 for |0-0| the moment |1-2| , |3-3| this judgment |4-5| is not |6-8| respected . |9-10| 
 this is |0-1| a problem |2-3| between a |4-5| South American |7-9| country |6-6| and |10-10| a |11-11| Central American |13-13| countries |12-12| . |14-14| 
 the conflicts |0-1| are inevitable |2-3| , |4-4| but |5-5| they must |6-7| be |8-8| overwhelmed by |9-10| the |11-11| desire to |12-13| move forward together |14-15| . |16-16| 
 they need to be addressed |0-3| as a whole |4-6| to overtake them |7-9| and |10-10| move forward |11-14| . |15-15| 
 at the same time |0-3| , |4-4| he expressed confidence |5-9| in |10-10| the proper |11-12| resolution |13-13| of the |14-14| dispute over |15-16| the |17-17| maritime border |18-19| between |20-21| Peru |22-23| and |24-24| Chile |25-26| in the |27-29| same court |30-31| , and |32-32| he |33-33| said he |34-37| is &quot; |38-39| beneficial as |40-41| Latin America |42-44| seize |45-45| international forums |46-48| if |49-49| the two countries |50-52| agree |53-54| to accept |55-56| a judgment |57-58| if |59-59| it |61-63| closes |60-60| . &quot; |64-65| 
 in |0-0| reference to |1-2| the possibility |3-4| of |5-5| his presentation |6-7| as a candidate in future |8-11| presidential elections |12-13| in Ecuador |14-15| , |16-16| to |17-19| run for a third |20-22| consecutive term |23-24| , |25-25| he said |26-28| that |29-29| he saw |30-31| this |32-32| opportunity |33-33| &quot; |34-34| with a lot |35-36| of optimism |37-38| and |39-40| joy |41-41| , although it is |42-46| sometimes quite |47-48| difficult |49-49| . &quot; |50-51| 
 Correa |0-0| assured |1-2| that , |3-4| if he lost |5-7| the |8-8| primary |9-9| in |10-10| February |11-11| 2013 |12-12| , it |13-14| would be withdrawing from |15-17| public life |18-20| . |21-21| 
 on a personal level |0-2| , |3-5| I was never |6-9| interested |10-10| , |11-11| but |12-12| in situations as |13-16| unfair |17-17| as those |18-19| of |20-20| Ecuador |21-22| , |23-23| socio |26-26| @-@ economic |27-28| poverty |24-25| cannot |29-30| be resolved only |31-33| through the |34-37| political power |38-39| . |40-40| 
 &quot; |0-0| my |1-1| political movement |2-3| believed |4-5| that |6-6| it was I |7-9| who |10-10| ensured |11-11| that |12-12| possible |13-13| victory |14-14| but |15-15| we must |16-17| accept |18-18| this responsibility |19-20| , &quot; |21-22| he |23-27| said |28-28| . |29-29| 
 if I won |0-2| , |3-3| it would be |4-5| my last |6-7| presidential term |8-9| and |10-10| then |14-14| I will retire |11-13| from political life |15-18| . |19-19| 
 if |0-1| we lose |2-3| , |4-4| I will do it |5-7| . |8-9| 
 &quot; it |0-1| is |2-2| my decision |3-4| , &quot; |5-6| he |7-11| said |12-12| . |13-13| 
 Correa |0-0| also referred |1-4| to the new |5-6| medical treatment |7-8| of the |9-9| Venezuelan president |10-11| , |12-12| Hugo |13-13| Chávez |14-14| , |15-15| in Cuba |16-17| . |18-18| 
 I |0-2| discuss with |3-4| the |5-5| Venezuelan |9-9| Vice President |6-8| Nicolás |10-10| Maduro |11-11| and |12-12| he |13-13| told me |14-16| that a |17-18| routine |21-22| medical treatment |19-20| was already |23-24| planned and |25-26| that he |27-28| was waiting for |29-29| the end |30-31| of the |32-33| campaign to |34-35| return to |36-37| Cuba |38-38| . |39-39| 
 &quot; |0-0| this does not mean |1-4| a relapse |5-6| of |7-7| the state of health |8-11| of President |12-13| Chavez |14-14| , &quot; |15-16| he |17-21| commented . |22-23| 
 the Head |0-1| of State |2-3| of Ecuador |4-4| participated |5-6| today |7-8| in Lima |9-10| in the sixth |11-12| Summit of |13-14| Heads of |15-16| State and Government |17-20| of |21-21| the Union of |22-24| South American |26-28| Nations |25-25| ( Unasur |29-30| ) , which |31-32| ended with |33-36| a call for |37-39| better regional integration |40-43| in order to |44-45| sustain |46-46| the |47-47| progress |48-48| , equality |49-51| and security |52-54| . |55-55| 
 the |0-0| AIDS @-@ |3-4| related deaths |1-2| are now |5-7| due to |8-9| late detection |10-12| . |13-13| 
 Fabrizio |0-0| was |1-1| 21 |2-2| years old when |3-4| he |5-6| confirmed |7-8| the test result |9-12| : |13-13| HIV @-@ positive . |14-15| 
 &quot; it |0-1| is |2-2| as if |3-4| the sky |5-6| had fallen |8-9| to me |7-7| on |10-10| the head |11-12| , &quot; he said |13-17| , |18-18| referring |19-20| to the |21-21| time of |22-23| the announcement |24-25| , |26-26| that |27-27| the doctor |28-29| had |30-30| tried to |31-32| make |33-33| &quot; less |34-35| painful |36-36| , &quot; |37-38| in vain |39-40| . |41-41| 
 the |0-0| young man |1-2| had |3-4| hidden |5-5| in |6-6| his family |7-8| . |9-9| 
 he |0-0| decided to |1-3| take |4-5| one |6-6| of |7-7| his illness |8-9| and |10-10| began |11-12| to |13-13| learn |14-15| about him |16-18| and |19-19| his determination |20-21| was |22-23| such |24-24| that he |25-26| has just celebrated |27-29| his |30-30| 43rd |31-31| birthday . |32-33| 
 it is |0-1| , |2-2| without doubt |3-5| , |6-6| one of the |7-8| oldest |9-10| patients |11-11| of the |12-13| HIV |15-16| unit |14-14| of the |17-18| civil hospital |19-20| in Guadalajara |21-22| ( HCG |23-24| ) |25-25| , |26-26| in which |27-28| he found himself |29-32| in 1994 |33-34| after many |35-37| battles . |38-39| 
 Fabrizio |0-0| is living with |1-2| the |3-3| human immunodeficiency virus |4-8| ( HIV |9-10| ) |11-11| for 22 years |12-14| , |15-15| something |16-18| difficult to |19-20| imagine |21-21| in the early |22-24| 1990s |25-26| , |27-27| when there were |28-31| a lot of |32-33| doubts |34-34| , |35-35| few |36-37| treatment options |38-40| and |41-41| more |42-43| stigma |44-44| . |45-45| 
 then |0-0| , even |1-2| the director |3-4| of a |5-6| clinic in |7-8| the IMSS |9-10| avoided |11-11| to |12-13| say |14-14| goodbye |15-16| &quot; |17-17| because he was |18-21| speechless |22-23| . &quot; |24-25| 
 at that time |0-4| , |5-5| have the |6-7| AIDS |8-8| was |9-9| synonymous with |10-11| death |12-12| . |13-13| 
 today |0-1| , |2-2| it is |3-4| possible to |5-6| survive |7-8| this syndrome |9-10| and |11-11| to have |12-13| a |14-14| good quality |15-16| of life |17-18| . |19-19| 
 however |0-0| , ignoring |1-2| their disease |3-4| , many people |5-8| still |10-10| arrive |9-9| when |11-11| the virus |12-13| has already |14-15| caused damage |16-18| , |19-19| &quot; |20-20| exhausted |21-21| &quot; |22-22| their |23-23| immune system |24-25| and |26-26| are |27-27| victims of |28-29| opportunistic infections |30-31| . |32-32| 
 31 |0-0| years after |1-2| the onset |3-4| of AIDS |5-6| in |7-7| the world |8-9| , in |10-11| all cases |12-14| after |15-15| the first reported cases |16-19| , |20-20| &quot; |21-21| the |22-22| great victory |23-24| today is |25-27| that |28-28| the survival |29-30| of a |31-32| patient |33-33| who began |34-35| treatment |36-37| at the right time |38-40| and |41-41| the survival |42-43| of |44-44| the population |45-46| in general |47-48| is |49-49| exactly |50-50| the same |51-52| , &quot; |53-54| said |55-56| the head |57-58| of the |59-60| HIV |62-63| unit |61-61| of |64-64| HCG |65-65| , |66-66| Jaime |67-67| Andrade |68-68| Villanueva |69-69| and |70-70| it |71-71| takes |72-72| for |73-73| reference |74-74| that |75-75| this information |76-77| was |78-79| validated |80-80| in April this |81-84| year |85-85| in a |86-87| prestigious scientific |89-90| publication |88-88| . |91-91| 
 the |0-0| infectious disease specialist and |1-2| HIV |5-5| / |6-6| AIDS |7-7| expert |3-4| , |8-8| Andrade |9-9| Villanueva |10-10| , |11-11| said |12-13| that |14-14| since 2008 |15-16| , scientists |17-19| concluded |20-21| that AIDS |22-24| was no longer |25-27| a |28-28| deadly disease |29-30| , |31-31| but |32-32| that |33-33| the number |34-35| of years |36-37| of survival |38-39| and quality |40-42| of life |43-44| depended on the |45-46| level of |47-48| appropriation of the |49-50| immune system |51-52| than |53-53| were |54-54| patients |55-56| at the time |57-58| of diagnosis |59-60| , |61-61| with |62-62| better prospects |63-65| for those |66-67| non @-@ drug @-@ |68-72| : |73-73| up to |74-75| 30 |76-76| years for |77-78| a rate |79-80| of |81-81| CD4 |82-82| 200 |83-84| and |85-85| up to |86-87| 50 |88-88| years for |89-90| those |91-91| reaching a |92-93| rate of |94-95| 500 |96-96| CD4 |97-97| . |98-98| 
 simply put |0-2| , |3-3| this means |4-5| that |6-6| for |7-7| someone |8-9| who |10-10| would receive |11-11| a |12-12| positive |15-15| HIV |14-14| diagnosis |13-13| for |16-16| 25 years |17-18| , |19-19| &quot; |20-20| as long as he remains |21-24| under control |25-26| , |27-27| can live |28-29| without |30-30| problems |31-31| up to |32-33| 75 |34-34| years |35-35| , &quot; |36-37| explained |38-39| the scientist |40-41| asked |42-42| . |43-43| 
 to |0-1| put |2-2| this |3-4| in context |5-7| , |8-8| it should be |9-10| aware that |11-12| Mexican |18-18| life |16-17| expectancy |13-15| today is |19-21| 76 |22-23| years on average |24-26| . |27-27| 
 if it |0-1| is |2-2| true that |3-4| mortality |5-6| has declined |7-8| significantly |9-11| in recent |12-13| years , |14-15| in |16-16| the case |17-18| of Mexico |19-20| , |21-21| the number |22-23| of |24-24| people who died of |25-29| AIDS |30-30| rose from |31-33| 6,678 |34-34| cases |35-35| in 2007 |36-37| to |38-38| 4,862 |39-39| in 2011 |40-41| , |42-42| according to the |43-44| annual report |45-46| of UNAIDS |47-48| ) |49-49| , |50-50| but |51-51| it is |52-53| also true |54-55| that , |56-57| since |58-58| the onset |59-60| of AIDS |61-62| , |63-63| 60 |64-64| % |65-65| of patients |66-67| identified |68-68| on the |69-70| national database |71-74| died |75-76| . |77-77| 
 in |0-2| Jalisco , |3-4| 255 |5-5| people died |6-8| in 2011 |9-10| , |11-11| and |12-12| there have been |13-16| 187 |17-17| deaths |18-18| until |19-20| May this |21-23| year |24-24| ; |25-25| however |26-26| , it |27-28| assures us |29-30| that access to |31-34| antiretroviral drugs |35-36| is universal |37-38| since 2005 |39-40| . |41-41| 
 so why |0-1| is |2-6| there still |7-10| death |11-11| ? |12-12| 
 I |0-0| think that |1-2| the problem is not |3-7| access |8-10| to treatment |11-12| . |13-13| 
 that is how |0-4| I see it |5-7| , |8-8| this is |9-10| what happened |11-15| in our |16-17| hospital . |18-19| 
 over |0-0| the |1-1| past 12 years |2-4| at least |5-6| , |7-7| we have never |8-11| failed to |12-13| drugs , |14-15| the problem |16-17| is |18-18| that patients |19-21| arrive |22-22| at a very advanced stage |23-27| because |28-28| they do not know |29-32| they are infected |33-36| , |37-37| or else |38-39| they |40-41| learn |42-42| in the advanced stages |43-46| of |47-47| the disease |48-49| . |50-50| 
 it |0-0| gives us |1-2| an |3-3| indisputable fact |4-5| &quot; |6-6| nine |7-7| out of ten |9-10| patients |8-8| come when they |11-14| already have |15-16| an |17-17| opportunistic infection |18-19| , |20-20| what it takes to |21-25| have a greater impact |26-30| on |31-31| overall |34-34| mortality |32-33| is |35-37| achieving |38-39| earlier |41-42| diagnoses |40-40| and |43-43| , |44-44| for that |45-46| , we need to |47-49| offer |50-51| screening tests |52-54| on a massive scale |55-57| , |58-58| to all those |59-62| who request it |63-65| . &quot; |66-67| 
 experts |0-1| and members |2-4| of the |5-5| State Council |6-8| of AIDS prevention |9-12| of Jalisco |13-14| ( |15-15| Coesida |16-16| ) |17-17| agree on |18-20| its proposal |21-22| , |23-23| as well as |24-26| the patients themselves |27-31| , like |32-33| Fabrizio |34-34| , |35-35| who |36-36| had to |37-38| make |39-39| his |40-40| test |41-43| in |44-44| a private laboratory |45-47| , |48-48| simply because |49-51| a friend |52-53| had done |54-56| and |57-57| that , |58-59| despite |60-60| his |61-61| young age |62-63| , |64-64| he |65-65| was already |66-67| carrying the |68-69| AIDS |70-70| and |71-72| Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma |73-76| , |77-77| a cancer |78-81| is |82-82| one of the |83-85| common |87-87| complications |86-86| . |88-88| 
 everything changes |0-1| when |2-2| you learn |3-4| that |5-5| you have |6-7| AIDS |8-9| . |10-10| 
 some believe |0-1| that they |2-3| are going to die |4-5| and |6-6| don &apos;t want to know |7-10| . |11-11| 
 &quot; if |0-1| I die |2-4| , |5-5| it is better |6-8| that |9-9| I |10-11| broke out |12-12| three |13-13| times a |14-15| week |16-16| , &quot; |17-18| they say , |19-22| this is not |23-26| my case |27-28| . |29-29| 
 the change |0-1| was |2-3| beneficial , |4-5| I eat |6-7| well |8-8| , |9-9| I exercise |10-14| , |15-15| I take |16-17| my medication |18-19| . |20-20| 
 to date , |0-3| his parents |4-5| know |6-6| only |7-7| that he |8-9| is suffering |10-10| from cancer |11-13| . |14-14| 
 I have |0-1| a normal life |2-4| , |5-5| like anyone |6-9| else |10-11| . |12-12| 
 &quot; |0-0| I work |1-2| , |3-3| I have |4-5| a lot of |6-7| work |8-8| , |9-9| I travel |10-11| , |12-12| I have |13-14| an |15-15| active |18-18| sex life |16-17| , |19-19| but |20-20| partly responsible |21-21| , |22-22| I pay attention |23-25| to |26-26| me and |27-28| to |29-29| the other |30-31| person |32-32| , &quot; |33-34| says |35-35| Fabrizio |36-36| , |37-37| who |38-38| agreed |39-40| to share |41-42| his |43-43| intimacy |44-44| with |45-45| JALISCO ARE GROWING |47-47| youth |46-46| to help |48-49| , |50-50| through |51-52| his testimony |53-54| , |55-55| those who |56-57| are afraid |58-59| today |60-61| , |62-62| when |63-64| the march |65-66| of the |67-68| World Day |69-70| Against AIDS |71-73| . |74-74| 
 they |0-1| are |2-2| the test |3-4| , |5-5| if they |6-7| have |8-8| taken risks |9-11| , |12-12| the more they |13-14| will know |15-15| soon |16-16| whether they |17-18| are HIV @-@ positive |19-20| and |21-21| the better |22-24| , |25-25| and |26-26| if they |27-28| already have |29-30| a diagnosis |31-32| , |33-33| they need to know |34-38| that you can |39-42| live |43-43| like everyone else |44-47| , being |48-50| responsible . |51-52| 
 his message |0-1| summarizes |2-2| the slogan |3-4| of |5-5| the battle |6-7| against AIDS |8-10| in the year |11-13| 2012 |14-14| . |15-15| 
 condoms |0-1| on |2-2| the counter |3-4| 
 there are |0-2| many |3-4| gaps between |5-6| the |7-7| health |9-10| programs |8-8| and |11-11| the |12-12| ordinary citizen |13-14| , |15-15| argues |16-16| Ricardo |17-17| Salazar |18-18| , a journalist |19-20| from |21-21| Guadalajara |22-22| who |23-23| embraced |24-25| the cause |26-27| of HIV |28-29| . |30-30| 
 and |0-0| the biggest |1-3| lies in |4-5| prevention . |6-8| 
 in |0-0| all places |1-3| dedicated to |4-5| this , |6-7| &quot; |8-8| it |9-9| has actually |10-11| increased |12-12| the distribution |13-14| of condoms |15-16| , |17-17| before |18-18| they gave us one |19-23| or two |24-25| , |26-26| now |27-27| we have |28-31| a hundred |34-35| packages |32-33| , |36-36| it is all very well |37-40| , |41-41| but |42-42| the result is |43-45| that |46-47| even today |48-50| , some |51-52| do not have access |53-56| to condoms |57-58| , &quot; |59-60| he says |61-65| . |66-66| 
 among the most |0-2| vulnerable to |3-4| new infections |5-6| are |7-9| teenagers |10-11| . |12-12| 
 the question |0-1| : |2-2| &quot; |3-3| what do |4-8| you |9-10| do |11-12| ? |13-13| , &quot; |14-15| asked |16-16| with |17-17| sarcasm |18-18| and |19-19| value judgments |20-22| by |23-23| social workers |24-26| , |27-27| guidance counsellors , |28-32| pharmacists |33-34| and |35-35| health |38-39| professionals |36-37| , |40-40| is |41-41| the question |42-43| that |44-44| adolescents |45-46| do not want |47-50| to hear |51-52| , |53-53| ensures |54-54| the journalist |55-56| . |57-57| 
 he |0-0| proposes to |1-2| redirect |3-3| this |4-4| inefficient |6-6| distribution |5-5| ; |7-7| that condoms |8-10| are not |11-13| only |14-14| sold |15-15| at counters |16-17| , |18-18| but |19-19| they are found in |20-24| the distributors |25-26| of |27-27| public toilets |28-29| and places |30-33| frequented |34-35| youth |36-37| . |38-38| 
 it is not |0-4| to encourage |5-6| promiscuity |7-8| . |9-9| 
 it is |0-3| not |4-6| their |7-8| pay |9-9| girls |10-11| and |12-12| the motel |13-14| , |15-15| as |16-16| the Governor |19-20| Emilio |21-21| González |22-22| replied |17-18| when asked |23-27| if there would be |28-31| a distribution |32-33| of condoms |34-35| within |36-38| his administration |39-40| . |41-41| 
 &quot; this |0-1| is not like |2-5| this |6-6| that |7-7| operates |8-8| sexuality |9-10| , |11-11| it is best |12-14| to provide |15-16| condoms |17-18| to people |19-20| already |21-21| sexually active |22-23| , &quot; |24-25| he |26-30| said . |31-32| 
 figures |0-1| in Jalisco |2-3| 
 there are |0-1| ( |5-5| 12,158 |6-6| 13,435 |2-2| cumulative |4-4| cases |3-3| of AIDS |7-8| and |9-9| HIV |11-12| 1,317 |10-10| ) |13-13| . |14-14| 
 the State |0-1| is the |2-3| fourth |4-4| state |5-5| in the country |6-7| in the |8-8| number |9-9| of |10-10| new cases |11-12| and |13-13| cumulative AIDS cases |14-17| and |18-18| 13th |19-19| for |20-20| the number |21-22| of |23-23| HIV |25-26| patients |24-24| . |27-27| 
 92 |0-0| % |1-1| of the infections are |2-5| through sexual contact |6-8| , |9-9| blood @-@ |13-14| 6 % |10-12| and |15-15| 2 |16-16| % |17-17| by |18-18| perinatal |20-20| route |19-19| . |21-21| 
 it is estimated |0-1| that |2-2| 50,000 |3-3| people are living |4-5| with HIV |6-8| , as |9-10| recorded |14-14| in |11-11| each case |12-13| , |15-15| there are |16-18| 4 |19-19| or |20-20| 5 |21-21| persons |22-22| who are unaware of it |23-25| . |26-26| 
 a judgement |0-1| ratified |2-2| on appeal |3-4| by a |5-6| United |11-11| States court |7-10| ignores the |12-13| group &apos;s |18-19| debt restructuring |14-17| Vitro |20-20| granted |21-21| via |22-22| a |23-23| commercial |25-25| bankruptcy |24-24| in Mexico |26-27| . |28-28| the scenario |29-30| creates |31-31| a negative precedent |32-34| for |35-35| all |36-37| domestic companies |38-39| with |40-41| ramifications in |42-43| the |44-44| neighbouring countries |45-46| and |47-47| having |48-48| solvency problems |49-52| . |53-53| 
 so it looks like |0-3| the procedures |4-5| of |6-6| corporate |8-9| survival |7-7| authorized by |10-11| the |12-12| Mexican |14-14| laws |13-13| are not valid |15-18| in |19-19| the country |20-21| at the |22-23| Stripes |24-25| , |26-27| opposite view |28-28| of international agreements |29-31| . |32-32| 
 from a |0-1| practical point of view |2-5| , the |6-7| blow |8-9| to the |10-10| judgement |11-12| on 15 |13-14| June last year |15-16| by Judge |17-19| Harlin |20-20| Hale |21-21| of the |22-23| Bankruptcy |25-26| Court |24-24| for the |27-28| Northern District |29-30| of Texas |31-32| , |33-33| left |34-34| defenceless |38-39| Mexican |37-37| companies |35-36| face |40-41| the possibility |42-43| of embargo |44-45| of |46-46| their properties |47-48| beyond the |49-52| Bravo |53-53| . |54-54| 
 however , |0-1| the resolution |2-3| will |4-4| allow the |5-6| largest manufacturer |7-8| of |9-9| glass |10-10| from Mexico |11-12| to |13-14| the |15-15| United States Supreme |17-21| Court |16-16| based |22-24| on three |25-26| inconsistencies |27-27| . |28-28| 
 first , while |0-4| the judge in the case |5-9| said |10-10| that creditors |11-13| must |14-14| register |15-16| according to |17-17| the Bankruptcy Act |18-22| of the |23-23| United States |24-26| , |27-27| the Court |28-29| of |30-30| Appeals for the Fifth Circuit |31-34| , |35-35| based in |36-37| New Orleans |38-41| , says |42-43| that the |44-45| main |47-47| commercial |51-51| bankruptcy |49-50| procedure |46-46| is |48-48| formalised |52-52| in Mexico |53-54| . |55-55| 
 the |0-0| first point |1-2| would mean |3-3| to denounce |4-5| the |6-6| cooperation of |7-8| international procedure |9-10| in the |11-12| event of insolvency |13-15| of firms |16-17| with a |18-19| transnational |21-21| profile |20-20| . |22-22| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| the law |3-4| of the United |8-8| Nations |6-7| Model |5-5| for the |9-10| consistency |11-11| of the |12-12| International |15-15| Commercial Law |13-14| had |16-16| been |17-17| created |18-18| for this purpose |19-21| by taking |22-23| the American |24-25| Law Institute |26-27| as an arbitrator |28-29| . |30-30| 
 secondly |0-2| , the |3-4| ruling establishes |5-6| that without |7-8| the |9-9| intercompany |11-11| vote |10-10| , |12-12| recognized in |13-14| the |15-15| critical mass |16-17| of |18-18| commercial |21-21| bankruptcy |19-20| , |22-22| the |23-23| debts incurred |24-25| by |26-26| Vitro |29-29| subsidiaries |27-28| to the |30-31| parent company |32-33| , |34-34| the majority required for |35-38| the approval |39-40| of |41-41| the restructuring |42-43| could not |44-47| be obtained |48-49| . |50-50| 
 however , |0-1| the |2-2| Mexican |4-4| laws |3-3| recognize |5-5| this possibility |6-7| . |8-8| 
 in fact |0-1| , |2-2| the case |3-4| of |5-5| Vitro |6-6| is not |7-9| the first |10-11| to use |12-13| this plan |14-15| . |16-16| 
 here there is |0-3| a |4-4| half @-@ |5-6| dozen |7-8| examples , |9-10| including |11-12| Agremex |13-13| and |14-14| Comercial |15-15| Mexicana |16-16| , |17-17| which |18-18| the Federal Institute |19-21| of |22-22| Business |24-24| Bankruptcies |23-23| had |25-25| guaranteed |26-26| the debts |27-28| . |29-29| 
 moreover |0-1| , |2-2| what is certain |3-6| is that |7-8| , |9-9| because |10-10| there remained |11-12| the votes |13-14| of |15-15| subsidiaries , |16-17| of |18-18| all the |19-20| ways |21-21| of Vitro |24-25| creditors |22-23| who fought |26-29| against |30-30| it |31-31| in |32-32| the courts |33-34| of the |35-35| United States |36-38| , |39-39| that is |40-41| to say , |42-45| the |46-46| &quot; |48-48| vulture |49-49| funds |47-47| &quot; as |50-51| Aurelios |52-52| Capital , |53-54| Aurelios |55-55| Convergencia |56-56| , |57-57| Elliot |58-58| Internacional |59-59| and |60-60| Liverpool |61-61| Limited |62-62| , |63-63| would not have |64-66| obtained |67-67| the majority |68-69| . |70-70| 
 the vote |0-1| would have been |2-3| 45 |4-5| votes to |6-7| 37 |8-8| . |9-9| 
 given |0-1| omitted |2-2| by the court |3-5| of appeal |6-7| . |8-8| 
 on the other hand |0-3| , |4-4| Vitro |5-5| was |6-7| blamed |8-8| for the |9-10| difficult situation |11-12| he met |13-15| since 2008 |16-17| without stopping |18-20| at |21-21| the severe |22-23| economic crisis |24-25| that |26-26| faced off against the |27-28| United States |29-31| , |32-32| passing |33-33| the costs |34-35| to the |36-36| country . |37-38| 
 for now |0-2| , |3-3| the |4-4| family |6-8| company |5-5| González |9-9| Sada |10-10| file an appeal |11-12| before the |13-14| same court |15-16| of appeal |17-18| for the |19-21| vote to be held |22-24| in |25-25| its entirety |26-27| , |28-28| i.e. |29-32| with |33-33| the five |34-35| judges , |36-37| as only three |38-40| had |41-41| voted |42-42| . |43-43| 
 the use |0-1| of insurance |2-3| will |4-4| non |5-6| @-@ |7-7| prosperity and |8-9| requires |10-10| the revision |11-12| of the trial |13-14| by |15-15| a higher court |16-18| , |19-19| in |20-20| this case |21-22| the Supreme Court |23-25| of Justice |26-27| of the |28-28| United States |29-31| . |32-32| 
 the |0-0| most serious |1-2| is that |3-4| the court |5-6| had ignored |7-8| a document |9-10| sent |11-11| by |12-12| the government |13-14| of Mexico |15-16| on behalf |17-18| of |19-19| the amicus |20-21| curiae |22-22| ( |23-23| &quot; |24-24| friend |25-25| of |26-26| the court |27-28| &quot; ) |29-30| in which |31-32| was detailed |33-34| the procedure |35-36| followed by |37-38| Vitro |39-39| within the framework |40-42| of |43-43| the law |44-45| on business bankruptcies |46-49| , pointing out |50-52| that |53-54| the |55-55| release |56-56| of the |57-57| agreements signed |58-59| by |60-60| the two |61-62| countries to |63-64| bring it |65-66| to the same level as |67-70| paragraph |71-72| 15 of |73-74| the Bankruptcy Act |75-79| of the |80-80| United States |81-83| . |84-84| 
 in addition |0-1| , |2-2| he |3-3| said |4-4| that |5-5| the country |6-7| has adhered |8-10| to the principles |11-12| of the |13-14| United |18-18| Nations Commission |15-17| on |19-19| International Trade |20-22| , |23-23| that is |24-25| to say |26-29| the rules |30-32| for |33-33| cross @-@ border |38-38| insolvency |36-37| cases |34-35| , |39-39| which guarantee |40-41| fairness |42-43| for |44-44| debtors |45-46| and creditors |47-49| . |50-50|

 &quot; |0-0| I wore |1-3| several |4-4| hats |5-5| in |6-6| basketball |7-10| throughout |11-14| my life |15-16| , |17-17| and even |18-19| more |20-20| at the same |21-22| time , |23-24| as |25-25| when I was |26-28| chairman |29-29| of the NSO |30-31| , |32-32| general manager |33-34| of |35-35| the national team |36-38| and |39-39| president of |40-41| the federation |42-43| in the 1990s |44-47| , &quot; recalls |48-51| Reyes |52-52| during a visit |53-56| to |57-57| his home in |60-62| Bayamón |63-63| Primera Hora |58-59| , where |64-65| he resides |66-67| with |68-68| Isabel |69-69| , |70-70| his |71-71| faithful |72-72| wife |73-73| for more than |74-76| 50 |77-77| years |78-78| . |79-79|

 Bayamón |0-0| in |1-1| the |2-3| 
 for |0-0| all his |1-2| memories , |3-4| those he |5-7| loves |8-8| the most are |9-11| those who |12-13| reminds him of |14-15| his time |16-17| as a player |18-19| within |20-22| the |23-23| vaqueros |26-26| team |24-25| in the mid @-@ |27-29| 1950s |30-31| until |32-33| 1982 |34-34| , |35-35| after 15 |36-39| years |40-40| as co |41-44| @-@ manager |45-46| and |47-47| manager |48-48| of |49-49| the team |50-51| . |52-52| 
 &quot; it |0-1| was |2-3| my |4-4| best years |5-6| , |7-7| those |8-8| which I have |9-11| most |12-13| benefited |14-14| because |15-16| I had |17-19| the |20-20| chance to |21-22| participate in |23-24| eight |25-25| of the |27-27| vaqueros |28-28| championships |26-26| from |29-31| 1967 |32-32| , either |33-36| as a |37-37| manager |38-38| , co |39-40| @-@ manager |41-42| or |43-43| leader . |44-45| 
 that &apos;s a lot |0-2| of years |3-4| of satisfaction |5-6| , |7-7| including |8-9| the five |10-11| disputed |13-13| championships |12-12| from 1971 to |14-16| 1975 |17-17| . |18-18| 
 I then |0-3| withdrawn |4-4| during the |5-6| championship |7-7| in 1981 |8-9| , |10-10| the year when |11-13| Jerome |14-14| Mincy |15-15| entered |16-18| the |19-19| NSO &apos;s |21-22| team |20-20| . |23-23| 
 from there |0-3| , |4-4| &quot; |5-5| Cuco |6-6| &quot; |7-7| Ortiz |8-8| , |9-9| who |10-10| was a great |11-13| administrator , |14-15| took |16-17| the helm of |18-20| the team |21-22| , &quot; |23-24| said |25-25| Reyes |26-26| . |27-27| 
 I remember |0-2| that |3-3| Gene |4-4| Bartow |5-5| , |6-6| who |7-7| had |8-8| been |9-9| leader |10-10| here and |11-12| who |13-13| was at |14-16| the University |17-18| of Alabama |19-20| ( |21-21| Birmingham |22-22| ) |23-23| , |24-24| told me |25-27| : |28-28| &quot; |29-29| I have |30-31| a |32-32| big |34-34| player |33-33| for you |35-36| , |37-37| it measures |38-39| two |40-40| metres |41-41| . |42-42| 
 you |0-0| want it |1-2| ? |3-3| &quot; |4-4| 
 that has |0-4| to |5-5| begin |6-6| Mincy |7-7| , |8-8| one of the |9-10| best players |11-12| that |13-13| have been |14-15| Puerto |16-16| Rico |17-17| . |18-18| 
 Bartow |0-0| then |3-3| recommended |4-4| Raymond |5-5| respect |6-6| me |1-2| , |7-7| who |8-8| has |9-9| been |10-10| naturalized |11-11| and |12-12| who was |13-14| one of |15-16| the best |17-17| shooters |18-18| . |19-19| 
 I remember |0-2| that |3-3| he said |4-5| that if |6-7| Bayamon |12-12| Mincy |8-8| had |9-9| helped |10-11| to win |13-14| a championship |15-16| , |17-17| respect |18-18| would |19-19| help us |20-22| try to |23-25| win |26-26| another |27-28| . |29-29| 
 he |0-0| was |1-2| pleased with the |3-4| championship |5-5| of the |6-6| vaqueros |7-7| with |8-8| respect |9-9| , |10-10| but only |11-12| at a distance |13-14| as |15-15| in 1988 |16-17| he |18-18| was already |19-20| the czar of |21-24| the federation |25-26| . |27-27| 
 at that time |0-4| , |5-5| he preferred to |6-7| take advantage of |8-9| its expenses |10-11| and |12-13| those of |14-15| Mincy |16-16| in |17-17| the national team |18-20| . |21-21| 
 I remember |0-2| when |3-3| we |4-6| won |7-7| for the |8-9| first time |10-11| in the United States |12-15| during the |16-17| pre |19-19| @-@ Olympic |20-21| tournament |18-18| in Mexico City |22-23| in 1989 |24-25| . |26-26| 
 then |0-1| there was |2-5| the |6-6| 1990 |8-9| World Cup |7-7| , where |10-11| we arrived |12-14| 4th and |15-16| where |17-17| we would have |18-19| had to |20-20| win the |21-22| bronze |24-25| medal |23-23| if the |26-27| Canadian judge |28-29| , we |30-31| did not |32-34| play |35-35| the last game , |36-39| &quot; said |40-41| Reyes |42-42| . |43-43| 
 the team |0-1| of the |2-2| 1990 |4-5| World Cup |3-3| is |6-6| the best |7-10| national team |11-12| that you have |13-15| ? |16-17| 
 it is one of the |0-3| best |4-4| , |5-5| like |6-7| the one that |8-9| beat |10-11| the |12-12| Dream Team |13-14| at the |15-16| 2004 Olympic |18-20| Games |17-17| . |21-21| 
 but |0-0| my favourite |1-2| is the one |3-4| of the Pan American Games |5-7| in |8-8| Cuba |9-9| in 1991 |10-11| , |12-12| when we |13-15| won |16-16| the gold |17-18| and |19-19| we put |20-23| a |24-24| beating |25-25| on the |26-27| United |32-32| States team |28-31| , which |33-34| was quite |35-36| similar to |37-38| the one that |39-40| won |41-42| bronze |43-44| at the |45-46| World Cup |47-47| . |48-48| 
 this team |0-1| was not |2-4| only |5-5| composed of |6-7| Mincy |8-8| , |9-9| respect |10-10| , |11-11| Ramon |12-12| Rivas |13-13| , |14-14| Fico |15-15| López |16-16| and &quot; |17-18| Piculín |19-19| &quot; ( |20-21| Ortiz |22-22| ) |23-23| , |24-24| there was also |25-28| the young |29-30| ( |31-31| Javier |32-32| ) |33-33| &quot; |34-34| Toñito |35-35| &quot; |36-36| Colón |37-37| and James |38-39| Carter , |40-41| the brothers |42-43| León |44-44| ( |45-45| Francisco |46-46| and |47-47| Edgar |48-48| ) |49-49| and Mario |50-51| &quot; |52-52| Quijote |53-53| &quot; |54-54| Morales |55-55| , |56-56| who was unable to |57-61| attend the |62-63| 90 |66-66| World |64-65| because |67-68| of a |69-70| knee |73-73| problem |71-72| . |74-74| 
 a team that |0-2| was |3-4| perhaps not |5-8| the best |9-10| in terms |11-12| of individuals |13-14| , |15-15| but it |16-17| gave us |18-20| a |21-21| gold medal |22-24| and |25-25| a great joy |26-28| at the |29-30| pre |32-32| @-@ Olympic |33-34| tournament |31-31| of Neuquén |35-36| in Argentina |37-38| . |39-39| 
 with |0-0| players like |1-3| &quot; |4-4| Canito |5-5| &quot; |6-6| Nieves |7-7| , |8-8| Pablo |9-9| Alicea |10-10| and |11-11| the young |12-13| Rolando |14-14| Hourruitiner |15-15| replacing |16-17| players |18-19| suspended |20-20| by |21-21| the mess |22-23| of the Pan American Games |24-26| in |27-27| Mar |28-28| del |29-29| Plata |30-30| , |31-31| we have |32-33| won |34-34| gold |35-36| against |37-37| all |38-39| predictions |40-40| . |41-41| 
 what was the |0-3| best player |4-5| of |6-6| Puerto |7-7| Rico |8-8| ? |9-9| 
 without doubt |0-2| , |3-3| it is |4-7| Piculín |8-8| Ortiz |9-9| . |10-10| 
 its statistics |0-1| at |2-3| international tournaments |4-6| are impressive |7-8| . |9-9| 
 person |0-0| in Puerto |1-2| Rico |3-3| has |4-5| dominated |6-6| at this level |7-9| , as did |10-13| Piculín |14-14| . |15-15| 
 and this |0-1| without taking |2-3| into account |4-5| its trajectory |6-7| in different |8-10| leagues |11-11| for which |12-13| he |14-14| has played |15-16| . |17-17| 
 that |0-0| was |1-2| the best |3-4| Puerto Rican |6-6| leader |5-5| ? |7-7| 
 it is |0-1| very difficult |2-3| to say . |4-6| 
 we had a good |0-4| team of |5-7| Julio |8-8| Toro , |9-10| Flor |11-11| Melendez |12-12| , |13-13| Carlos |14-14| Morales |15-15| , |16-16| Raymond |17-17| Dalmau |18-18| , |19-19| Armandito |20-20| Torres |21-21| . |22-22|

 this semester |0-1| , |2-2| when the |3-4| professor |5-5| of religion |6-7| Stuart |8-8| charmed |9-9| decided |10-11| to give |12-13| a course |14-15| on |16-16| the end |17-18| of the world |19-20| , |21-21| he knew |22-23| that he |24-25| was launching |26-26| an |27-28| irresistible |30-30| hook |29-29| : |31-31| the end |32-33| of the |34-34| &quot; |35-35| countdown |36-37| &quot; |38-38| of the |39-39| Maya calendar |40-41| , |42-42| on 21 |43-44| December |45-45| , |46-46| referred to by |47-49| many |50-52| as |53-54| proof |55-56| of the |57-58| imminent |62-62| end of the world |59-61| . |63-63| 
 but |0-0| Professor |1-2| charmed |3-3| had no idea |4-8| what awaited them |9-12| in the following months |13-17| : |18-18| the catastrophic hurricane |19-21| Sandy |22-22| , |23-23| a |24-24| fiscal |26-26| abyss |25-25| that some |27-28| have |29-29| dubbed &quot; |30-31| the |32-32| debt |34-36| Armageddon |33-33| &quot; and |37-38| a |39-39| growing conflict |40-41| involving |42-42| Israel |43-43| , the |44-45| place where |46-47| Christian |50-50| theorists |48-49| of |51-51| the end times |52-55| thought |56-56| that |57-58| would trigger |59-59| the apocalypse |60-61| . |62-62| 
 &quot; |0-0| I didn |1-4| &apos;t realize |5-7| that this |8-9| was going to |10-10| be |11-11| the |12-12| most |14-15| apocalyptic |16-16| half |13-13| that |17-17| I have never |18-21| experienced |22-22| , &quot; said |23-26| this week |27-28| Professor |29-30| charmed |31-31| his |32-33| students at |34-35| Rutgers University |36-38| @-@ |39-39| Camden |40-40| , New Jersey |41-44| . |45-45| 
 if |0-0| you look at what |1-4| has happened |5-7| in |8-8| the world |9-10| today |11-12| as if |13-14| we were |15-16| 30 |17-17| days later |18-20| and |21-22| told |25-25| us |23-24| , it |26-27| was |28-29| a very good |30-32| period . |33-34| 
 and |0-0| we must |1-2| remember |3-4| that |5-5| what is bad |6-9| is |10-10| good for |11-12| those who |13-14| believe in |15-16| the apocalypse |17-18| . |19-19| 
 and |0-0| it is not |1-4| the only |5-6| teacher |7-7| to teach courses |8-11| on |12-12| &quot; |13-13| the end |14-15| of the world |16-17| &quot; |18-18| this semester |19-20| , which |21-22| will , |23-24| in theory |25-26| , |27-27| the last |28-29| of |30-30| the story |31-32| . |33-33| 
 at |0-0| Temple |1-1| , the |2-3| assistant professor |4-5| Barry |6-6| vacker |7-7| provides |8-8| the course |9-10| &quot; Media |11-12| , |13-13| Culture |14-14| and the end |15-16| of the world |17-18| . &quot; |19-20| 
 each |0-0| week |1-1| , students |2-4| explore |5-6| apocalyptic |8-8| themes |7-7| such as |9-9| nuclear war |10-12| , |13-14| shouldn &apos;t , |15-16| viruses |17-18| and germs |19-21| and |22-22| global warming |23-25| . |26-26| 
 &quot; |0-0| we analyze |1-2| this because |3-4| these ideas |5-6| are proliferating |7-7| over time |8-10| , &quot; |11-12| he |13-17| said |18-18| , |19-19| and |20-20| the |21-21| manner in which |22-23| they offer |24-25| hypothetical scenarios |26-28| guide |29-29| some |30-31| human conduct |32-33| . |34-34| 
 if |0-0| nuclear weapons |1-3| fell into |4-5| the hands |6-7| of terrorists |8-9| , |10-10| for example |11-12| , |13-13| a war |14-15| could erupt |16-17| . |18-18| 
 this month |0-3| , students |4-6| will analyze |7-7| films |8-9| with |10-11| apocalyptic |13-13| themes |12-12| and consider |14-15| how |16-16| they can |17-18| be compared |19-20| with |21-22| real @-@ life |24-27| examples |23-23| . |28-28| 
 &quot; |0-0| I tried |1-3| to tell |4-5| my students |6-7| about what |8-10| was possible |11-12| , |13-13| probable , |14-15| credible and |16-17| impossible |18-18| , &quot; |19-20| says |21-22| vacker |23-23| . |24-24|

 &quot; |0-0| we add |1-2| &quot; |3-3| 2012 |4-4| &quot; to |5-6| have the opportunity |7-9| to give |10-11| the course |12-13| again |14-15| , |16-16| if |17-19| the world |20-21| does |22-22| not |24-24| would disappear |23-23| , &quot; said |25-28| Professor |29-30| Restall |31-31| . |32-32| 
 despite |0-0| the |1-1| &quot; |2-2| looming disaster |3-4| , &quot; |5-6| students must |7-9| study |10-10| , |11-11| develop projects |12-14| and |15-15| spend their |16-17| final exams |18-19| . |20-20| 
 in |0-0| the State |1-2| of Pennsylvania |3-4| , |5-5| the |6-6| final exam |7-8| will be |9-9| spent |10-10| on the eve |11-12| of |13-13| the Apocalypse |14-15| , |16-16| which |17-18| does not allow |19-21| the |22-22| student |23-23| choice but |24-27| to work |28-29| &quot; |30-30| until |31-32| the night |33-34| of |35-36| the |37-37| supposed |41-41| end of the world |38-40| , &quot; said |42-45| Berg |46-46| . |47-47| 
 the courses |0-1| have proved |2-4| quite |5-5| popular . |6-7| 
 &quot; |0-0| it |1-1| was |2-3| complete in |4-5| two hours |6-7| , &quot; |8-9| said |10-11| Restall |12-12| on |13-15| its |16-16| course for |17-19| high @-@ level |21-23| students |20-20| , |24-24| composed of |25-26| 35 |27-27| students . |28-29| 
 we have |0-1| received messages |2-4| by |5-5| e @-@ mail |6-7| several |8-8| weeks before |9-10| the beginning |11-12| of the semester |13-14| , |15-16| the share |17-18| of people |19-20| who |21-21| asked |22-22| if there was |23-26| still room |27-30| . |31-31| 
 students |0-1| , |2-2| for |3-3| their part |4-5| , ensure |6-7| that the course |8-10| is |11-11| one of the |12-14| most interesting |15-16| . |17-17| 
 &quot; it |0-1| fascinates me |2-3| to see |4-5| what people |6-9| are capable |10-11| of doing |12-13| to |14-14| comfort |15-16| , &quot; says |17-19| Bridgid |20-20| Robinson |21-21| , |22-22| a student |23-24| in |25-25| religion |26-26| and |27-27| sociology |28-28| of |29-29| 23 |30-30| years old , from |31-34| Haddonfield |35-35| , |36-36| New Jersey |37-38| , |39-40| Rutgers |44-44| University |41-43| @-@ |45-45| Camden |46-46| . |47-47| 
 because |0-0| the fear |1-2| of |3-3| the Apocalypse |4-5| , whether |6-9| secular |10-10| or religious |11-12| , |13-13| is |14-14| only |15-15| a matter |16-17| of comfort |18-19| , |20-20| or |21-22| lack |23-23| of comfort |24-25| . |26-26| 
 will |0-0| Wekesa |1-1| , |2-2| a student |3-4| in Psychology |5-6| and |7-7| mentions |8-8| of |9-9| 25 years |10-11| , |12-12| claims to have |13-14| viewed |15-15| all |16-17| apocalyptic |19-19| films |18-18| . |20-20| 
 &quot; |0-0| I had never |1-4| heard of |5-7| a course |8-9| that |10-10| taught |11-11| this matter |12-13| , &quot; |14-15| he |16-20| said |21-21| . |22-22| 
 I appreciate it |0-2| . |3-3| 
 but |0-0| none of the |1-2| students |3-3| interviewed |4-4| , much less |5-8| a professor |9-10| , |11-12| told us |13-15| to believe in |16-17| the end date |18-21| of the world |22-23| of 21 |24-25| December |26-26| . |27-27| 
 &quot; our |0-1| first project |2-3| dealt with |4-5| the |6-6| Mayan |8-8| prophecy |7-7| , |9-9| and |10-10| somehow |11-14| we have |15-17| discredited |18-18| , &quot; |19-20| said |21-21| Julie |22-22| zegle |23-23| , |24-24| final @-@ year |26-28| student |25-25| at |29-29| Temple |30-30| , aged 21 |31-35| and |36-36| a native of |37-38| West |39-39| Chester |40-40| . |41-41| 
 the Mayans |0-1| never |2-4| predicted |5-5| the end |6-7| of the world |8-9| , |10-10| it is only |11-15| a |16-16| key date |17-18| on |19-19| the calendar |20-21| , |22-22| Berg |25-25| said |23-24| . |26-26| 
 but |0-0| I admit |1-2| that there is |3-5| anxiety related |6-8| to |9-9| the apocalypse |10-11| in |12-12| Western culture |13-15| , |16-16| dating back |17-17| several |18-19| centuries |20-20| , |21-21| which is |22-23| that |24-24| people respond |25-27| to changes |28-29| in |30-30| their environment |31-32| by predicting |33-34| the end |35-36| of the world |37-38| . |39-39| 
 the Internet |0-1| has led to |2-3| a boom |4-5| of such |6-7| speculation . |8-9| 
 &quot; in |0-1| other |2-3| parts of the world |4-6| , people |7-9| do not believe |10-12| in |13-13| it |14-14| , &quot; |15-16| he says |17-21| . |22-22|
